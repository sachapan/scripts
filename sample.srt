<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re delighted you could join us.</font>

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,890
<font face="Serif" size="18">Welcome to JW Broadcasting®</font>

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,359
<font face="Serif" size="18">for December 2021!</font>

4
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead</font>

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,818
<font face="Serif" size="18">has now completed 150 classes!</font>

6
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,554
<font face="Serif" size="18">This certainly is a theocratic milestone</font>

7
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:40,223
<font face="Serif" size="18">made possible with Jehovah’s help.</font>

8
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,628
<font face="Serif" size="18">This 150th class was a little different.</font>

9
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,533
<font face="Serif" size="18">There were only 24 students,
which is much less than usual.</font>

10
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:55,505
<font face="Serif" size="18">And because of travel restrictions
based on the COVID-19 pandemic,</font>

11
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:58,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">all are citizens of the United States.</font>

12
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,646
<font face="Serif" size="18">Though this group
was different than in years past,</font>

13
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,715
<font face="Serif" size="18">the goal remained the same:</font>

14
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:09,486
<font face="Serif" size="18">to strengthen their faith
so that they can strengthen others</font>

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,388
<font face="Serif" size="18">wherever they are assigned.</font>

16
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:15,091
<font face="Serif" size="18">The graduation program helped the students</font>

17
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:19,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">to focus on key points
they will benefit from on into the future.</font>

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,933
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please enjoy Part 1 of the graduation</font>

19
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:28,004
<font face="Serif" size="18">that was held
on Saturday, September 11, 2021,</font>

20
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,173
<font face="Serif" size="18">at the Watchtower Educational Center</font>

21
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,175
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Patterson, New York!</font>

22
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:38,014
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’m going to go back many decades ago</font>

23
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:43,019
<font face="Serif" size="18">—Monday, March 6, 1972.</font>

24
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,257
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, some of you in the class weren’t alive.</font>

25
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,761
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think I know of one for sure who was alive.</font>

26
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:56,499
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s an inside joke, not In<i>side Story</i></font>

27
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">—but anyway.</font>

28
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,107
<font face="Serif" size="18">And along with my wife,
we had the privilege</font>

29
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,810
<font face="Serif" size="18">(and that was rare
unless you were a Bethelite)</font>

30
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">to attend the graduation</font>

31
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,648
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.</font>

32
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,450
<font face="Serif" size="18">That was the 52nd class.</font>

33
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we’re in the Assembly Hall</font>

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,423
<font face="Serif" size="18">(jam packed there in New York City)</font>

35
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">and just enjoying it.</font>

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,796
<font face="Serif" size="18">What a privilege for us to sit there</font>

37
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:30,200
<font face="Serif" size="18">and enjoy that program of the 52nd class!</font>

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,205
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now here we are almost 100
(just two shy) classes later</font>

39
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,341
<font face="Serif" size="18">—the 150th class.</font>

40
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,343
<font face="Serif" size="18">And now we’re grateful</font>

41
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:45,348
<font face="Serif" size="18">because many are tied in live as we speak.</font>

42
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:47,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">But then the rest of the brotherhood</font>

43
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:50,887
<font face="Serif" size="18">is going to have it available
in a few months.</font>

44
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">So boy, things have changed,
and they enjoy that privilege.</font>

45
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,559
<font face="Serif" size="18">But that was a rare privilege.</font>

46
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:00,163
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I remember
Brother Knorr was the chairman</font>

47
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,198
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the program.</font>

48
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:06,236
<font face="Serif" size="18">And certainly, he just loved Gilead.</font>

49
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,038
<font face="Serif" size="18">I mean, that you’ve got to give him.</font>

50
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:13,376
<font face="Serif" size="18">Of course, Jehovah used him mightily
to get it all started there</font>

51
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">—1943 was the first one.</font>

52
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:20,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">But knowing that the beast was coming out,</font>

53
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,687
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah blessed them and said,
‘Yeah, we need a missionary school.’</font>

54
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,923
<font face="Serif" size="18">There was a missionary school for years.</font>

55
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:31,261
<font face="Serif" size="18">But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention
is that I remember an outstanding talk.</font>

56
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:35,098
<font face="Serif" size="18">I had heard Brother Fred Franz
the summer before</font>

57
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">at the Yankee Stadium convention,</font>

58
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">but we were a little closer there
in the Assembly Hall.</font>

59
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:44,674
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I’ll tell you what;
I was just glued to him.</font>

60
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:47,243
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you had the privilege to hear him,
Jehovah blessed—</font>

61
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:50,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">He had a blessed, beautiful mind.</font>

62
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,949
<font face="Serif" size="18">He could just quote these scriptures.</font>

63
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I’ve told folks:</font>

64
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,087
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Now, if you don’t pay attention
and stay with him,</font>

65
00:03:58,087 --> 00:04:00,089
<font face="Serif" size="18">“you’re going to get lost.</font>

66
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,257
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’s going to lose you.”</font>

67
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:04,027
<font face="Serif" size="18">But if you paid attention,
it was thrilling</font>

68
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:06,696
<font face="Serif" size="18">just to hear him pour out his heart</font>

69
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">because it was all written
on his figurative heart.</font>

70
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,868
<font face="Serif" size="18">But he discussed Ecclesiastes 5.</font>

71
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:15,905
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s why I was thinking
of bringing it up for your class here.</font>

72
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because this is really directed to you.</font>

73
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,377
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he spoke there about vows.</font>

74
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:25,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">In those first seven verses,
dreams are mentioned.</font>

75
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:30,553
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I appreciate it because it just struck me
when he mentioned it.</font>

76
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:35,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">The dreams don’t refer to dreams
one has while they’re sleeping</font>

77
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,293
<font face="Serif" size="18">because of the busy day.</font>

78
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:40,229
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, you can’t get that on your own</font>

79
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,567
<font face="Serif" size="18">by just reading Ecclesiastes
with whatever version you have.</font>

80
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:48,171
<font face="Serif" size="18">It had to do with getting sidetracked</font>

81
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:50,606
<font face="Serif" size="18">with personal pursuits.</font>

82
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:53,509
<font face="Serif" size="18">These dreams
—these are the things they’re doing.</font>

83
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,247
<font face="Serif" size="18">And that would be “vanity”
(as we’d said then).</font>

84
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,249
<font face="Serif" size="18">So let’s just take a moment</font>

85
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:04,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">(you here in the class and others
who want to follow along in Ecclesiastes 5)</font>

86
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">and just touch on some of the nice things.</font>

87
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,092
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, of course, you could—</font>

88
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,161
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, don’t do it right now,
but you can do it later.</font>

89
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,164
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have access to the <i>Research Guide</i></font>

90
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,434
<font face="Serif" size="18"><i>—an</i></font><font face="Serif" size="18"> in-depth understanding</font>

91
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">of this wisdom in Ecclesiastes.</font>

92
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,741
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Brother Franz addressed it.</font>

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example, verse 1 says: “Watch your step.”</font>

94
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:32,248
<font face="Serif" size="18">So this is for you soon-to-be graduates.</font>

95
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah is saying: “Watch your step.”</font>

96
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,352
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don’t stop doing that.</font>

97
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:41,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have thus far,
so continue to “watch your step.”</font>

98
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,595
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he mentions those morally “stupid ones.”</font>

99
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,597
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s not you.</font>

100
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,599
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can avoid that.</font>

101
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,702
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then I love this in verse 2:</font>

102
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Do not be quick with your mouth.”</font>

103
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,276
<font face="Serif" size="18">Boy, there are a lot of people in the world
who could benefit from that counsel.</font>

104
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,278
<font face="Serif" size="18">Isn’t that true?</font>

105
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:06,215
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s like:
‘Does he or she ever shut up?</font>

106
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:09,786
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘I mean, they must—
I bet you they talk in their sleep.</font>

107
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,055
<font face="Serif" size="18">They just won’t shut up.’</font>

108
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then, anyway,
‘don’t be quick with your mouth,’</font>

109
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">particularly in context here</font>

110
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,796
<font face="Serif" size="18">when you’re speaking to Jehovah.</font>

111
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,798
<font face="Serif" size="18">Boy, those are some good things
to keep in mind,</font>

112
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,133
<font face="Serif" size="18">especially for you brothers
who will speak in public.</font>

113
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,771
<font face="Serif" size="18">But you sisters too, when it’s personal
with your prayers to Jehovah,</font>

114
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,773
<font face="Serif" size="18">don’t be quick with your mouth</font>

115
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,177
<font face="Serif" size="18">when you approach
the Sovereign of the universe.</font>

116
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:36,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your words should be few.</font>

117
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:40,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">You do not impress God with vocabulary.</font>

118
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,053
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’s impressed with sincerity of heart.</font>

119
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:49,792
<font face="Serif" size="18">He loves those who love him.</font>

120
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">And in all different languages,
he treasures those prayers.</font>

121
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,698
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then he mentions this:</font>

122
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:59,135
<font face="Serif" size="18">“A dream comes
from too many preoccupations.”</font>

123
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:02,972
<font face="Serif" size="18">In the revised Bible here,
it says “too many cares.”</font>

124
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:07,944
<font face="Serif" size="18">So this idea isn’t just dreams
from a busy, busy day.</font>

125
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,947
<font face="Serif" size="18">This preoccupation with self</font>

126
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:14,150
<font face="Serif" size="18">is being warned against here.</font>

127
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,420
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don’t do it.
See, do not do it.</font>

128
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,290
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don’t be preoccupied with yourself.</font>

129
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">And for those who are,
there are many words from them.</font>

130
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:28,197
<font face="Serif" size="18">But be careful, you know.</font>

131
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,668
<font face="Serif" size="18">You have the privilege now;
you’ll be praying more in public</font>

132
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:35,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">—probably more than you ever have before.</font>

133
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,507
<font face="Serif" size="18">You get privileges, you know.</font>

134
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:42,078
<font face="Serif" size="18">And when you’re praying to Jehovah,
sometimes—</font>

135
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,981
<font face="Serif" size="18">We don’t want to be counseling
or criticizing prayers.</font>

136
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,249
<font face="Serif" size="18">We try to be careful of that.</font>

137
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:50,119
<font face="Serif" size="18">But sometimes you even hear
a prayer at Bethel, and it’s like:</font>

138
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:54,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘OK. We’re trying to eat breakfast here.’</font>

139
00:07:57,326 --> 00:08:01,898
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I’ve told folks that it’s like,
you know, I just can’t help but—</font>

140
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:06,602
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus is there, the most eloquent person
to walk the planet,</font>

141
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">and the meal comes.</font>

142
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:12,375
<font face="Serif" size="18">He ‘raised his eyes to heaven’
and “gave thanks.”</font>

143
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,877
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Amen.</font>

144
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,315
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s eat.”</font>

145
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:22,485
<font face="Serif" size="18">I mean, there are other times
you want to pour out your heart and all that,</font>

146
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:26,255
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you’re not praying to the audience.</font>

147
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,925
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re talking
to the Sovereign of the universe.</font>

148
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,127
<font face="Serif" size="18">The counsel is, you know—</font>

149
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,362
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Now I’m a Gilead graduate</font>

150
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:36,532
<font face="Serif" size="18">(you brothers particularly),
so I’m going to have longer prayers.”</font>

151
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:38,801
<font face="Serif" size="18">I hope not.</font>

152
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,271
<font face="Serif" size="18">I sure hope not unless they’re private.</font>

153
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,442
<font face="Serif" size="18">But then he gets into something crucial,</font>

154
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,447
<font face="Serif" size="18">and it’s just so important
to keep in mind verse 4.</font>

155
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,483
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s read verses 4 and 5:</font>

156
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,953
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Whenever you make a vow to God,</font>

157
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,122
<font face="Serif" size="18">“do not delay to pay it,</font>

158
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">for he finds no pleasure
in the stupid ones [morally stupid].”</font>

159
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,262
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then it’s very clear:</font>

160
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,764
<font face="Serif" size="18">“What you vow, pay.”</font>

161
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">“What you vow, pay.”</font>

162
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:15,304
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then:
“[It’s] better for you not to vow</font>

163
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,907
<font face="Serif" size="18">than to vow and not pay.”</font>

164
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">So this is serious counsel,</font>

165
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,947
<font face="Serif" size="18">and the warning is,
Don’t allow your mouth to cause you to sin.</font>

166
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:30,753
<font face="Serif" size="18">So when it comes to vows
(and some of you are married),</font>

167
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,755
<font face="Serif" size="18">well, you have the vow.</font>

168
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,258
<font face="Serif" size="18">You always have to hold on to that.</font>

169
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s not a light matter with Jehovah God.</font>

170
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:41,163
<font face="Serif" size="18">And any other vows—be careful.</font>

171
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,966
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you’re going to make a vow,
it’s between you and him.</font>

172
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:47,103
<font face="Serif" size="18">But see, notice here:</font>

173
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:51,307
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Do not allow [in verse 6]
your mouth to cause you to sin,</font>

174
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,876
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and do not say before the angel</font>

175
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,979
<font face="Serif" size="18">“[see, think about this]</font>

176
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,015
<font face="Serif" size="18">that it was a mistake.”</font>

177
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,119
<font face="Serif" size="18">So Jehovah has the angels
doing all sorts of things.</font>

178
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,421
<font face="Serif" size="18">We don’t even begin to know the things</font>

179
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">that are always going on all the time</font>

180
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,027
<font face="Serif" size="18">with Jehovah’s servants and his holy angels.</font>

181
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s priceless.</font>

182
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:16,432
<font face="Serif" size="18">But see, angels are, according to this,</font>

183
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,734
<font face="Serif" size="18">assigned to check on these things.</font>

184
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:21,037
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you don’t say to the angel:</font>

185
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Why, look, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.”</font>

186
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,543
<font face="Serif" size="18">Uh-uh.</font>

187
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,578
<font face="Serif" size="18">You made a vow.</font>

188
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">But see, it shouldn’t be
because an angel is going to check</font>

189
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,184
<font face="Serif" size="18">that that’s Jehovah’s direction.</font>

190
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:39,855
<font face="Serif" size="18">It should be
because of our love for Jehovah.</font>

191
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:45,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">When you make a vow (you know,
whether it was marriage or whatever),</font>

192
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:50,032
<font face="Serif" size="18">it’s your love for Jehovah
—that’s what cements the vow.</font>

193
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,034
<font face="Serif" size="18">It matters.</font>

194
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:55,538
<font face="Serif" size="18">See, it matters to him.</font>

195
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,609
<font face="Serif" size="18">So then finally, in verse 7:</font>

196
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:04,246
<font face="Serif" size="18">“For just as many preoccupations
lead to dreams,</font>

197
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:08,351
<font face="Serif" size="18">so, too, many words lead to futility.”</font>

198
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,686
<font face="Serif" size="18">So it’s good counsel.</font>

199
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:14,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">You are so filled</font>

200
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,559
<font face="Serif" size="18">with the Word of God.</font>

201
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,561
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is a special class,</font>

202
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:22,598
<font face="Serif" size="18">and Gilead is a special school.</font>

203
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:26,802
<font face="Serif" size="18">We have other schools, SKE;
I’ll mention something later about that.</font>

204
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:29,372
<font face="Serif" size="18">But this is unique</font>

205
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:33,109
<font face="Serif" size="18">—to have men whom
Jehovah has appointed to instruct.</font>

206
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,746
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Teaching Committee selects them</font>

207
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:41,016
<font face="Serif" size="18">—totally whole-souled
and devoted to Jehovah God—</font>

208
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,686
<font face="Serif" size="18">to teach you during the class.</font>

209
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you’re going over all these things
in the Word of God.</font>

210
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,592
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so it’s all in there,</font>

211
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,628
<font face="Serif" size="18">and it’s just special.</font>

212
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,499
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you thank Jehovah
that you have this education,</font>

213
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:01,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you’re going
to move forward to glorify him.</font>

214
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:06,776
<font face="Serif" size="18">And that’s pretty similar
to what is mentioned here</font>

215
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:10,446
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the last sentence in verse 7:</font>

216
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:14,150
<font face="Serif" size="18">“But fear the true God.”</font>

217
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,152
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you soon-to-be graduates,</font>

218
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">keep those words in your heart.</font>

219
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,359
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just “fear the true God” in the days ahead,</font>

220
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:28,197
<font face="Serif" size="18">and stay away from these kind of dreams</font>

221
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:32,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">about self-preoccupation, you know?</font>

222
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:36,639
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mm-mm.
No, not for you.</font>

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,144
<font face="Serif" size="18">Otherwise, your education was futile,</font>

224
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,813
<font face="Serif" size="18">not good.</font>

225
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:47,416
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I don’t see that in any of you
(and I’m not implying).</font>

226
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">But it’s such wise counsel</font>

227
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,822
<font face="Serif" size="18">from Jehovah God in his Word.</font>

228
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,057
<font face="Serif" size="18">So there’s much, much more there.</font>

229
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,827
<font face="Serif" size="18">Enjoy thinking about it</font>

230
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:01,831
<font face="Serif" size="18">with a little tool we have there,
the <i>Research Guide.</i></font>

231
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:07,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, we appreciate the next speaker very much</font>

232
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,206
<font face="Serif" size="18">(and he put his heart into his talk),</font>

233
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,775
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother Mark Sanderson.</font>

234
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,144
<font face="Serif" size="18">And we have a nice lineup</font>

235
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:17,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the brothers who’ve prepared their talks</font>

236
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,182
<font face="Serif" size="18">with all their heart.</font>

237
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:22,184
<font face="Serif" size="18">Mark is a member of the Governing Body,</font>

238
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:26,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">and his talk is a question as a theme,</font>

239
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:30,125
<font face="Serif" size="18">“What Will They Be Like?”</font>

240
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,794
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother Sanderson, please.</font>

241
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:44,573
<font face="Serif" size="18">At Luke 6:40, Jesus said:</font>

242
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,511
<font face="Serif" size="18">“A student is not above his teacher,</font>

243
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:52,248
<font face="Serif" size="18">“but everyone who is perfectly instructed</font>

244
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,718
<font face="Serif" size="18">will be like his teacher.”</font>

245
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:59,455
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, now, what comes to your mind
when you think about this verse?</font>

246
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">Maybe you tend to think of it in terms</font>

247
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:04,527
<font face="Serif" size="18">of when you conduct
a Bible study with someone.</font>

248
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,529
<font face="Serif" size="18">Or you might think about it</font>

249
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">when you go to a program like Gilead</font>

250
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,101
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you’re instructed there.</font>

251
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,470
<font face="Serif" size="18">But in reality,</font>

252
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">we are all teachers every day</font>

253
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:23,112
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the classroom of Christian living.</font>

254
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,814
<font face="Serif" size="18">If we have responsibilities,</font>

255
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,584
<font face="Serif" size="18">if we enjoy certain privileges,</font>

256
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:33,222
<font face="Serif" size="18">our brothers and sisters will watch us.</font>

257
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:36,559
<font face="Serif" size="18">And those who work closely with us</font>

258
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,594
<font face="Serif" size="18">will learn from us.</font>

259
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:43,566
<font face="Serif" size="18">And they will become like us.</font>

260
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:47,036
<font face="Serif" size="18">Take the example of the apostle Paul.</font>

261
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,673
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, we know Paul
was an outstanding teacher.</font>

262
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:51,874
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can you imagine?</font>

263
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:56,579
<font face="Serif" size="18">Under inspiration,
he had the privilege to write 14 books</font>

264
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,048
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</font>

265
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,685
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yet, that was not the only way</font>

266
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,220
<font face="Serif" size="18">that the apostle Paul taught others.</font>

267
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,791
<font face="Serif" size="18">His example in Christian living</font>

268
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,960
<font face="Serif" size="18">was very powerful.</font>

269
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,830
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, what could people learn
from the example of Paul?</font>

270
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s consider some examples.</font>

271
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:21,837
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,</font>

272
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:25,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">1 Thessalonians chapter 2,</font>

273
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,943
<font face="Serif" size="18">and let’s look at verse 7:</font>

274
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:32,881
<font face="Serif" size="18">“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,</font>

275
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,919
<font face="Serif" size="18">“as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.</font>

276
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,322
<font face="Serif" size="18">“So having tender affection for you,</font>

277
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,524
<font face="Serif" size="18">“we were determined to impart to you,</font>

278
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">“not only the good news of God</font>

279
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,764
<font face="Serif" size="18">“but also our very selves,</font>

280
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:53,769
<font face="Serif" size="18">because you became so beloved to us.”</font>

281
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,339
<font face="Serif" size="18">Paul worked hard for the brothers.</font>

282
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,774
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was kind.</font>

283
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,209
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was gentle with them.</font>

284
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,880
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was willing to give
not just the message of the truth but,</font>

285
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,718
<font face="Serif" size="18">as he says in verse 8, “our very selves.”</font>

286
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:14,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">And brothers, that was the truth.</font>

287
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,527
<font face="Serif" size="18">Paul said he was willing to do “all things</font>

288
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,663
<font face="Serif" size="18">for the sake of the good news.”</font>

289
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,298
<font face="Serif" size="18">And just consider
some of the things that he did.</font>

290
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:26,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11</font>

291
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:30,939
<font face="Serif" size="18">and just remind ourselves of some
of the things Paul went through.</font>

292
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:35,944
<font face="Serif" size="18">Second Corinthians 11:23</font>

293
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,747
<font face="Serif" size="18">—Paul says:
“Are they ministers of Christ?</font>

294
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,785
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I reply like a madman,
I am more outstandingly one:</font>

295
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:46,388
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I have done more work,
been imprisoned more often,</font>

296
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:50,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">“suffered countless beatings,
and experienced many near-deaths.</font>

297
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:55,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,</font>

298
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,766
<font face="Serif" size="18">“three times I was beaten with rods,</font>

299
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:02,304
<font face="Serif" size="18">“once I was stoned,
three times I experienced shipwreck,</font>

300
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:05,841
<font face="Serif" size="18">a night and a day
I have spent in the open sea.”</font>

301
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,878
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the list just goes on.</font>

302
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:14,416
<font face="Serif" size="18">What could these ones</font>

303
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,319
<font face="Serif" size="18">who worked with Paul learn from him?</font>

304
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,756
<font face="Serif" size="18">In other words, how did
Paul’s powerful example</font>

305
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,758
<font face="Serif" size="18">of love for God,</font>

306
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,561
<font face="Serif" size="18">of endurance, of hard work,</font>

307
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,930
<font face="Serif" size="18">and of true unselfishness</font>

308
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,366
<font face="Serif" size="18">affect those around him?</font>

309
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:35,337
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, consider Timothy,
who worked so closely with Paul.</font>

310
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,206
<font face="Serif" size="18">What did Paul say about him?</font>

311
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:41,944
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s go to Philippians chapter 2</font>

312
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:46,882
<font face="Serif" size="18">—Philippians 2:20.</font>

313
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:50,385
<font face="Serif" size="18">Paul said: “For I have no one else</font>

314
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,554
<font face="Serif" size="18">“of a disposition like his</font>

315
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:55,991
<font face="Serif" size="18">“who will genuinely care for your concerns.</font>

316
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,727
<font face="Serif" size="18">“For all the others
are seeking their own interests,</font>

317
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:01,330
<font face="Serif" size="18">“not those of Jesus Christ.</font>

318
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,566
<font face="Serif" size="18">“But you know the proof he gave of himself,</font>

319
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:06,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">“that like a child with a father</font>

320
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:11,306
<font face="Serif" size="18">he slaved with me
to advance the good news.”</font>

321
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,675
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, now, here’s a question:</font>

322
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,578
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why was Timothy that way?</font>

323
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:19,515
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why was Timothy so unselfish?</font>

324
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,619
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why did he work so hard for other people?</font>

325
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,856
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, no doubt, he was “perfectly instructed”</font>

326
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,259
<font face="Serif" size="18">not just by the words</font>

327
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:33,896
<font face="Serif" size="18">but by the example of Paul.</font>

328
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:37,132
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, the same thing
could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.</font>

329
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:41,904
<font face="Serif" size="18">Paul said about them
that they had risked their necks for him.</font>

330
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,908
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, where did they learn that from?</font>

331
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,343
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see, we could go on
with other examples</font>

332
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:52,648
<font face="Serif" size="18">of other close associates of Paul,
but what is the point?</font>

333
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:55,851
<font face="Serif" size="18">Paul’s example in Christian living</font>

334
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,453
<font face="Serif" size="18">instructed those around him.</font>

335
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,456
<font face="Serif" size="18">They became like Paul.</font>

336
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:06,428
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, why is that important to you
who are graduating today</font>

337
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,798
<font face="Serif" size="18">from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?</font>

338
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,635
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, very soon you’re going to be graduates,</font>

339
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">and your mandate is to go forth</font>

340
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,408
<font face="Serif" size="18">and strengthen and stabilize</font>

341
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,277
<font face="Serif" size="18">the field and branch territory.</font>

342
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,913
<font face="Serif" size="18">But now, that’s a big long term, isn’t it?</font>

343
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,750
<font face="Serif" size="18">What is the field and branch territory?</font>

344
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,752
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s people.</font>

345
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,523
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s people
—spiritual men and women</font>

346
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,459
<font face="Serif" size="18">who want to learn,</font>

347
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,761
<font face="Serif" size="18">who want to be trained,</font>

348
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:44,399
<font face="Serif" size="18">who want to reach the spiritual goals
that they’ve set for themselves,</font>

349
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">and who want to grow to Christian maturity.</font>

350
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,374
<font face="Serif" size="18">And because you are a Gilead graduate,</font>

351
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:56,945
<font face="Serif" size="18">they will watch you, they will listen to you,</font>

352
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:01,917
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they will be instructed by your example.</font>

353
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,519
<font face="Serif" size="18">When I went to serve many years ago</font>

354
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,956
<font face="Serif" size="18">where the need was great
on the island of Newfoundland,</font>

355
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,426
<font face="Serif" size="18">we were so blessed
to have in our congregation</font>

356
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:16,398
<font face="Serif" size="18">a graduate of the 7th class of Gilead,
Brother Fred Wiens.</font>

357
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:20,202
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother Wiens was an anointed brother
who was baptized</font>

358
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">in 1928.</font>

359
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:25,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, I’ll be honest with you;</font>

360
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:29,811
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don’t remember even one talk
that Fred Wiens gave.</font>

361
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,982
<font face="Serif" size="18">But his warmth, his sense of humor,</font>

362
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,819
<font face="Serif" size="18">his zeal for the ministry,
and his love for people</font>

363
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,489
<font face="Serif" size="18">—the example that he set—</font>

364
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,325
<font face="Serif" size="18">is truly unforgettable.</font>

365
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,294
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fred talked to everyone</font>

366
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:48,397
<font face="Serif" size="18">—and I mean everyone—
in the ministry.</font>

367
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:52,901
<font face="Serif" size="18">One time we were out in service;
we pulled into the gas station.</font>

368
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,737
<font face="Serif" size="18">As soon as we stopped the car,
Fred jumped out.</font>

369
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">And when we were ready to leave,</font>

370
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,475
<font face="Serif" size="18">we looked around to try to find Fred.</font>

371
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:03,478
<font face="Serif" size="18">He wasn’t in the store;
he wasn’t in the bathroom.</font>

372
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,380
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was nowhere to be seen.</font>

373
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">Finally, we thought
we’d check the other cars.</font>

374
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,153
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, that’s exactly where Fred was.</font>

375
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:14,389
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fred had knocked on the window
and gotten in a car</font>

376
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:19,027
<font face="Serif" size="18">and started to preach
to all the people in that car.</font>

377
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,731
<font face="Serif" size="18">Fred has now gone on to his reward.</font>

378
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:26,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">But his example of warmth, kindness,</font>

379
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:31,106
<font face="Serif" size="18">zeal, and love for people
continue to teach me</font>

380
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:35,677
<font face="Serif" size="18">—and many others who knew him well—
right down to this day.</font>

381
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:40,349
<font face="Serif" size="18">So here is the question
that rests before you:</font>

382
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:45,187
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will you teach others by your example?</font>

383
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,222
<font face="Serif" size="18">Be like Paul.</font>

384
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,126
<font face="Serif" size="18">Love your brothers and sisters
right from your heart.</font>

385
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:53,228
<font face="Serif" size="18">Through your example,</font>

386
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:57,265
<font face="Serif" size="18">create an atmosphere of warmth and love</font>

387
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:00,702
<font face="Serif" size="18">like a greenhouse
where young plants</font>

388
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,405
<font face="Serif" size="18">can blossom and grow.</font>

389
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,743
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your fine example
can warm up a congregation,</font>

390
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:12,748
<font face="Serif" size="18">a circuit, a Bethel department,
perhaps even a branch office.</font>

391
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,784
<font face="Serif" size="18">Never allow yourself</font>

392
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:19,287
<font face="Serif" size="18">to be a cold executive</font>

393
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:24,192
<font face="Serif" size="18">who creates an atmosphere like a freezer,</font>

394
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:27,229
<font face="Serif" size="18">because those little plants</font>

395
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,264
<font face="Serif" size="18">will shrivel up</font>

396
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:33,135
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they will stop growing
in that environment.</font>

397
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:37,305
<font face="Serif" size="18">Yes, be willing to impart
not just the many wonderful truths</font>

398
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:39,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">of God’s Word that you learned at Gilead</font>

399
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,879
<font face="Serif" size="18">but also your own heart and your own soul.</font>

400
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:48,483
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then because those beautiful,
spiritual people you work with</font>

401
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:51,720
<font face="Serif" size="18">will be properly instructed,</font>

402
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,523
<font face="Serif" size="18">what will they be like?</font>

403
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:58,493
<font face="Serif" size="18">They will be just like you.</font>

404
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,563
<font face="Serif" size="18">And may the blessing
of our marvelous God, Jehovah,</font>

405
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:03,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">go with you wherever you go.</font>

406
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson,</font>

407
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,445
<font face="Serif" size="18">for that interesting Scriptural discussion</font>

408
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:19,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">and some of those past experiences.</font>

409
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,983
<font face="Serif" size="18">Of course, the brother might be saying,</font>

410
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,586
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘You should have paid
closer attention to my talks.’</font>

411
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,055
<font face="Serif" size="18">No, no.</font>

412
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was obvious how much you loved him.</font>

413
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:34,729
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, OK.</font>

414
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:37,332
<font face="Serif" size="18">Clive Martin,
a helper to the Writing Committee,</font>

415
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:41,169
<font face="Serif" size="18">is going to address us now
with this interesting theme,</font>

416
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,439
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Remember the Terms of Peace?”</font>

417
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:49,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">Have you ever had to sue for peace?</font>

418
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,314
<font face="Serif" size="18">While you’re thinking of that question,</font>

419
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:55,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">would you please turn with me
to Luke chapter 14?</font>

420
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,920
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’d like to put you and me</font>

421
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the middle of one of Jesus’ illustrations.</font>

422
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,227
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus has been talking about what it costs</font>

423
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,729
<font face="Serif" size="18">to become one of his disciples.</font>

424
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:11,566
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then in verse 31, he says:</font>

425
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,735
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Or what king</font>

426
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,905
<font face="Serif" size="18">“[this is where we come in, what king]</font>

427
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:19,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">“marching out against another king in war</font>

428
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,945
<font face="Serif" size="18">“does not first sit down and take counsel
whether he is able with 10,000 troops</font>

429
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:28,717
<font face="Serif" size="18">“to stand up to the one who comes
against him with 20,000?</font>

430
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,819
<font face="Serif" size="18">“If, in fact, he cannot do so,</font>

431
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:34,623
<font face="Serif" size="18">“then while that one is yet far away,</font>

432
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:39,161
<font face="Serif" size="18">he sends out a body of ambassadors
and sues for peace.”</font>

433
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:45,367
<font face="Serif" size="18">How do you think that conversation goes?</font>

434
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:48,370
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I want peace, and these are my terms.”</font>

435
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,705
<font face="Serif" size="18">Hardly!</font>

436
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:55,110
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s more like:
“I don’t want to be your enemy.</font>

437
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,748
<font face="Serif" size="18">Please tell me what to do
so that I can have peace with you.”</font>

438
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,987
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, with that in mind,
Jesus gives the application, verse 33:</font>

439
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:10,425
<font face="Serif" size="18">“In the same way, you may be sure
that not one of you</font>

440
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">“who does not say good-bye
to all his belongings</font>

441
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">can be my disciple.”</font>

442
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,834
<font face="Serif" size="18">That is you and me.</font>

443
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,836
<font face="Serif" size="18">We got to the point where we realized</font>

444
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,606
<font face="Serif" size="18">we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.</font>

445
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,510
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so we were willing
to sacrifice everything</font>

446
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">—belongings, career, status, everything—</font>

447
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:35,483
<font face="Serif" size="18">for the privilege of being
at peace with Jehovah</font>

448
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,552
<font face="Serif" size="18">and being a disciple of his Son.</font>

449
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,189
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now for you students of class 150,</font>

450
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:43,792
<font face="Serif" size="18">your pursuit of peace with Jehovah</font>

451
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,761
<font face="Serif" size="18">has led you
into the special full-time service.</font>

452
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:50,765
<font face="Serif" size="18">And what a beautiful record
every one of you has set!</font>

453
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,003
<font face="Serif" size="18">You remind me in many ways</font>

454
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:57,339
<font face="Serif" size="18">of a group in the Bible</font>

455
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:00,742
<font face="Serif" size="18">that literally sued for peace.</font>

456
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:04,512
<font face="Serif" size="18">Their story is told
in the book of Joshua chapter 9.</font>

457
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:08,717
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s right;
we’re talking about the Gibeonites.</font>

458
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:11,186
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do you have Joshua chapter 9?</font>

459
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:14,990
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, they had heard of all the things
that Jehovah had done</font>

460
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,094
<font face="Serif" size="18">for his people, Israel, and to his enemies.</font>

461
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,563
<font face="Serif" size="18">They did not want to be Jehovah’s enemy.</font>

462
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:26,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so they did exactly
what the king in Jesus’ illustration did.</font>

463
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,037
<font face="Serif" size="18">They sent a body of ambassadors.</font>

464
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,973
<font face="Serif" size="18">So Joshua chapter 9</font>

465
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:35,944
<font face="Serif" size="18">—and this is the opening overture</font>

466
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:39,314
<font face="Serif" size="18">in verse 6:</font>

467
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:41,816
<font face="Serif" size="18">“We have come from a distant land.</font>

468
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:44,552
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now make a covenant with us.”</font>

469
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:50,759
<font face="Serif" size="18">When they didn’t get a very warm
initial reception, they persisted.</font>

470
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,663
<font face="Serif" size="18">Verse 8: “We are your servants.”</font>

471
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:59,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">In other words,
“Set the terms; we want peace.”</font>

472
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">They were willing to sacrifice everything</font>

473
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:07,108
<font face="Serif" size="18">in order to enjoy peace
with Israel and with Israel’s God.</font>

474
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:11,646
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, Joshua and the chieftains
didn’t see it exactly the same way,</font>

475
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">particularly when they found out</font>

476
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:17,352
<font face="Serif" size="18">that they were not from a distant land
as they had claimed.</font>

477
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:19,354
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nobody likes to be fooled.</font>

478
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:22,724
<font face="Serif" size="18">So the tone got a little sterner.</font>

479
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,794
<font face="Serif" size="18">So turn and look at verse 23.</font>

480
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:29,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is what they said:
“From now on you are cursed,</font>

481
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,467
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and you will always occupy
a slave’s position</font>

482
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:36,671
<font face="Serif" size="18">as gatherers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.”</font>

483
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,308
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will the Gibeonites say to that?</font>

484
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:45,447
<font face="Serif" size="18">Verse 25: “We are at your mercy.</font>

485
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,851
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do to us whatever you think
is good and right.”</font>

486
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:54,723
<font face="Serif" size="18">And just so, the terms of peace were set.</font>

487
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:58,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">Verse 27: “That day Joshua made them</font>

488
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,129
<font face="Serif" size="18">“gatherers of wood and drawers of water</font>

489
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,898
<font face="Serif" size="18">“for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar</font>

490
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:06,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">“at the place that He should choose,</font>

491
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,436
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they remain so to this day.”</font>

492
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:13,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">So now a few questions, a few lessons.</font>

493
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:16,611
<font face="Serif" size="18">What do you think
of the Gibeonites’ assignment?</font>

494
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:20,482
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was presented to them as a punishment.</font>

495
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,250
<font face="Serif" size="18">But just think,</font>

496
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,653
<font face="Serif" size="18">they weren’t being sold off
as household slaves.</font>

497
00:28:25,653 --> 00:28:29,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">Their humble service
would directly contribute</font>

498
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:33,561
<font face="Serif" size="18">to pure worship and support Jehovah’s people.</font>

499
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,865
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s a privilege, isn’t it?</font>

500
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:41,436
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s the kind of service
we reach out for as a privilege.</font>

501
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, the kind of service—</font>

502
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:49,444
<font face="Serif" size="18">Was it because they were lowly people,</font>

503
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:54,349
<font face="Serif" size="18">no skills to do anything else,
that they were given this kind of job?</font>

504
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:57,619
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, look at chapter 10</font>

505
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,621
<font face="Serif" size="18">and verse 2</font>

506
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:03,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">and see the kind of people
the Gibeonites were:</font>

507
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:07,429
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Gibeon was a great city,
like one of the royal cities.</font>

508
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,866
<font face="Serif" size="18">“It was greater than Ai,
and all its men were warriors</font>

509
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:16,771
<font face="Serif" size="18">[capable, skilled people].”</font>

510
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,040
<font face="Serif" size="18">However,</font>

511
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">clearly the Gibeonites realized</font>

512
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:24,746
<font face="Serif" size="18">that if their army was no match for Israel,</font>

513
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">then Jehovah didn’t need them</font>

514
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,485
<font face="Serif" size="18">to bolster his army
in order to complete the conquest.</font>

515
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,654
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was better for them</font>

516
00:29:32,654 --> 00:29:37,392
<font face="Serif" size="18">to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do
and to do that.</font>

517
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:42,363
<font face="Serif" size="18">So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.</font>

518
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:47,135
<font face="Serif" size="18">Does that mean, though,
that their skills were irrelevant,</font>

519
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:49,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">never even considered?</font>

520
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,005
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, no.</font>

521
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:53,942
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example, a few hundred years later,</font>

522
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:55,977
<font face="Serif" size="18">Ishmaiah the Gibeonite</font>

523
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:59,881
<font face="Serif" size="18">is listed among David’s 30 mighty men.</font>

524
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,918
<font face="Serif" size="18">Different needs call for different skills.</font>

525
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:07,422
<font face="Serif" size="18">What did Ishmaiah do with his skill?</font>

526
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:12,327
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, he humbly defended pure worship
and Jehovah’s people.</font>

527
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,563
<font face="Serif" size="18">So the details of the assignment
were different,</font>

528
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,299
<font face="Serif" size="18">but the focus was about the same.</font>

529
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,671
<font face="Serif" size="18">Another question: Was this just</font>

530
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:26,574
<font face="Serif" size="18">a short-term starter assignment?</font>

531
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Yes, we will do this for now,
but once the campaign is over,</font>

532
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:34,616
<font face="Serif" size="18">we’ll be able to resume
our regular place in society.”</font>

533
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:39,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">Go back to verse 27 of chapter 9.</font>

534
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:42,724
<font face="Serif" size="18">Remember what Joshua said at this point</font>

535
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,425
<font face="Serif" size="18">when he gave them their assignment?</font>

536
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">“They remain so to this day.”</font>

537
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,066
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not only to the day
that Joshua wrote these words</font>

538
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,504
<font face="Serif" size="18">but about 900 years later</font>

539
00:30:56,504 --> 00:31:00,675
<font face="Serif" size="18">among the exiles that returned
from Babylon to Jerusalem</font>

540
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:04,913
<font face="Serif" size="18">to restore pure worship
there were temple servants,</font>

541
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,048
<font face="Serif" size="18">and likely</font>

542
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:10,351
<font face="Serif" size="18">this included descendants of the Gibeonites.</font>

543
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:13,888
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just think, these temple servants</font>

544
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:18,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">once again were willing to leave behind
the life that they’d built up</font>

545
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,930
<font face="Serif" size="18">to make the trek in behalf of pure worship</font>

546
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">and take up their duties.</font>

547
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:27,235
<font face="Serif" size="18">They must have really cherished
their assignment</font>

548
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:29,571
<font face="Serif" size="18">in order to stick to it that way.</font>

549
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,975
<font face="Serif" size="18">So as we’ve talked about them,</font>

550
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,778
<font face="Serif" size="18">have you been noting some personal lessons?</font>

551
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:39,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">These are the four that come to my mind.</font>

552
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:43,284
<font face="Serif" size="18">Number one, as with the king</font>

553
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:46,854
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Jesus’ illustration and the Gibeonites,</font>

554
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:50,258
<font face="Serif" size="18">peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.</font>

555
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:53,962
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re willing to sacrifice
anything to enjoy it.</font>

556
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:58,666
<font face="Serif" size="18">Number two, Jehovah’s terms for us</font>

557
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,536
<font face="Serif" size="18">include humble service</font>

558
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">on behalf of pure worship
and in support of his people,</font>

559
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,209
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that kind of humble service</font>

560
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:11,613
<font face="Serif" size="18">we view as the greatest privilege.</font>

561
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:16,217
<font face="Serif" size="18">Number three, different needs
call for different skills,</font>

562
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:20,021
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that may lead to a change of assignment</font>

563
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">for you or for someone else.</font>

564
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:26,995
<font face="Serif" size="18">Either way, we don’t compete
and we don’t compare.</font>

565
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:29,530
<font face="Serif" size="18">The details of the assignment
may be different,</font>

566
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,234
<font face="Serif" size="18">but the focus, or goal, is always the same.</font>

567
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:36,137
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the fourth one,</font>

568
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,373
<font face="Serif" size="18">we cherish our assignments.</font>

569
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,710
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re going to stay in them
as long as Jehovah allows.</font>

570
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:47,081
<font face="Serif" size="18">In short, we cherish our assignments;</font>

571
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,350
<font face="Serif" size="18">we love our God.</font>

572
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:53,354
<font face="Serif" size="18">Peace with Jehovah is a treasure
that we will never let go.</font>

573
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,230
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you very much.</font>

574
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,666
<font face="Serif" size="18">We appreciated that very much.</font>

575
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:07,101
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re now at peace, Brother Martin.</font>

576
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:10,672
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you
for those kind, encouraging thoughts.</font>

577
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:14,976
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, this is something special
for you here in the class,</font>

578
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:19,881
<font face="Serif" size="18">the 150th class of Gilead.</font>

579
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:24,085
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, you may be wondering
about your post-graduation life.</font>

580
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,488
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’ve probably been doing that
at least a couple of weeks.</font>

581
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:32,026
<font face="Serif" size="18">And how will you use
what you’ve learned from Gilead</font>

582
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,395
<font face="Serif" size="18">to strengthen and stabilize</font>

583
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,298
<font face="Serif" size="18">the branch organization and others?</font>

584
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:41,769
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Brother Sanderson touched on that,</font>

585
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,172
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you’ll hear more later about that.</font>

586
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,441
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s our purpose.</font>

587
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,976
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, here’s a question to ponder.</font>

588
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,879
<font face="Serif" size="18">What if you could look down the road</font>

589
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,782
<font face="Serif" size="18">—let’s say 2, 4, 6,</font>

590
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,152
<font face="Serif" size="18">or even 30 years</font>

591
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:02,156
<font face="Serif" size="18">into the future from this day of graduation?</font>

592
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,494
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’d be nice to be able to do.</font>

593
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,730
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, we’re pleased to inform you</font>

594
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,866
<font face="Serif" size="18">that the Teaching Committee has included</font>

595
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,535
<font face="Serif" size="18">at this graduation a special feature</font>

596
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:17,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">in connection with this graduation.</font>

597
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:21,275
<font face="Serif" size="18">It consists of four prerecorded interviews</font>

598
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:26,047
<font face="Serif" size="18">of Gilead graduates
currently in their assignments.</font>

599
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,316
<font face="Serif" size="18">And all four of the brothers</font>

600
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,786
<font face="Serif" size="18">are serving on Branch Committees;</font>

601
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,921
<font face="Serif" size="18">they’re Branch Committee members.</font>

602
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:36,724
<font face="Serif" size="18">So the interviews will begin now,</font>

603
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:41,729
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then another will follow
each of the next three parts of the program.</font>

604
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:44,465
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we’ll have a part and then an interview.</font>

605
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:47,001
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, first,
we’re going to travel to the country</font>

606
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:51,005
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</font>

607
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">There we find a brother who graduated</font>

608
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:57,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">from the 138th class of Gilead.</font>

609
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,016
<font face="Serif" size="18">Listen as he explains how his Gilead training</font>

610
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,418
<font face="Serif" size="18">has helped him to work humbly</font>

611
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:08,923
<font face="Serif" size="18">with his fellow brothers
and Branch Committee members.</font>

612
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:10,424
<font face="Serif" size="18">Enjoy the video.</font>

613
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,529
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother and Sister Kabitshwa</font>

614
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">will be returning to Congo.</font>

615
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:17,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s difficult</font>

616
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:19,000
<font face="Serif" size="18">to find one word,</font>

617
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">or expression,</font>

618
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:23,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">that can sum up what I personally feel</font>

619
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:25,640
<font face="Serif" size="18">after this training in Gilead.</font>

620
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,143
<font face="Serif" size="18">The in-depth study of Jehovah’s personality</font>

621
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:31,145
<font face="Serif" size="18">opened my eyes more fully</font>

622
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,548
<font face="Serif" size="18">to the way he values people.</font>

623
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">And this has helped me to look</font>

624
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:39,387
<font face="Serif" size="18">for opportunities to strengthen others</font>

625
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,558
<font face="Serif" size="18">by placing their interests above my own.</font>

626
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example, my wife and I</font>

627
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:48,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">made ourselves available
to support the brothers</font>

628
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,498
<font face="Serif" size="18">in cleaning a regional convention venue.</font>

629
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:53,601
<font face="Serif" size="18">They laughed, thinking that we were joking.</font>

630
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:55,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">And finally, they gave us</font>

631
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">humble tasks in cleaning.</font>

632
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:00,341
<font face="Serif" size="18">We did it with joy, and it allowed me</font>

633
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">to get to know the brothers
in the circuits better.</font>

634
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,146
<font face="Serif" size="18">Taking these opportunities</font>

635
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,616
<font face="Serif" size="18">has a much more profound effect
on the brothers</font>

636
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,718
<font face="Serif" size="18">than simply giving talks.</font>

637
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,620
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gilead has also helped me</font>

638
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,323
<font face="Serif" size="18">to show honor to the other members</font>

639
00:36:15,323 --> 00:36:17,358
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the Branch Committee.</font>

640
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:18,626
<font face="Serif" size="18">On the committee I serve,</font>

641
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:21,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">there are brothers of different age groups.</font>

642
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:24,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">While I feel that my normal inclination</font>

643
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,666
<font face="Serif" size="18">is to speak too much,</font>

644
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">I have learned from others on the committee</font>

645
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,804
<font face="Serif" size="18">how to humbly listen.</font>

646
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:33,574
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example, I had to present a concept
to the Branch Committee,</font>

647
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:36,811
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I put all my heart into the presentation.</font>

648
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:40,848
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was 100 percent sure it would be approved.</font>

649
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,316
<font face="Serif" size="18">Guess what?</font>

650
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:44,418
<font face="Serif" size="18">None of the options were approved.</font>

651
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:49,390
<font face="Serif" size="18">Honestly, inside myself,
I was upset and ready to give up.</font>

652
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,760
<font face="Serif" size="18">What helped me was meditating on the example</font>

653
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,396
<font face="Serif" size="18">of another fellow Branch Committee member</font>

654
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:58,766
<font face="Serif" size="18">and how he reacted in times like this.</font>

655
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,801
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks to Gilead, I have learned</font>

656
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:05,006
<font face="Serif" size="18">to benefit from the qualities
of each one of the brothers I work with,</font>

657
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:09,443
<font face="Serif" size="18">no matter who they are
or the experience they have.</font>

658
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,746
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah’s organization</font>

659
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:16,751
<font face="Serif" size="18">is made up of people
from different cultures and backgrounds,</font>

660
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:20,388
<font face="Serif" size="18">and these differences can at times be to us</font>

661
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:24,425
<font face="Serif" size="18">like a huge gap that threatens our unity.</font>

662
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:28,095
<font face="Serif" size="18">In one of our lessons at Gilead,</font>

663
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,865
<font face="Serif" size="18">Matthew 5:3 was used to show</font>

664
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:34,068
<font face="Serif" size="18">that the only way to bridge the gap</font>

665
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,537
<font face="Serif" size="18">is to be a spiritual person.</font>

666
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:39,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">So every time I’m overwhelmed</font>

667
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:42,209
<font face="Serif" size="18">by a feeling of inadequacy</font>

668
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,379
<font face="Serif" size="18">or I’m about to vent my frustrations,</font>

669
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,215
<font face="Serif" size="18">I reconnect to Jehovah and Jesus</font>

670
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:51,719
<font face="Serif" size="18">by studying the Bible and praying for help.</font>

671
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,988
<font face="Serif" size="18">I would definitely say that Gilead</font>

672
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,090
<font face="Serif" size="18">has given me all the tools I need</font>

673
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,359
<font face="Serif" size="18">to build the bridge of unity</font>

674
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,395
<font face="Serif" size="18">among Jehovah’s people whenever I see a gap</font>

675
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:05,266
<font face="Serif" size="18">—and that tool is
to feed my own spirituality.</font>

676
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:15,676
<font face="Serif" size="18">That was a nice addition for the program.</font>

677
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,912
<font face="Serif" size="18">We look forward to the other videos.</font>

678
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:21,315
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, next,
we have a helper to the Teaching Committee.</font>

679
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:23,684
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’s been so for a long time.</font>

680
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,686
<font face="Serif" size="18">I’m not picking on your age, Bill,</font>

681
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,323
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you look good.</font>

682
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,993
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s because his wife, Sandy,
is right out there,</font>

683
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,995
<font face="Serif" size="18">so I try to be careful.</font>

684
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,699
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, we always look forward
to what Brother Malenfant has</font>

685
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,701
<font face="Serif" size="18">to share with us.</font>

686
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,938
<font face="Serif" size="18">His theme is “‘Boast in Jehovah.’”</font>

687
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,145
<font face="Serif" size="18">There are many people who love to boast.</font>

688
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:55,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">Politicians frequently boast
about what they have done</font>

689
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:58,986
<font face="Serif" size="18">and what they have promised to do
for their constituents.</font>

690
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,988
<font face="Serif" size="18">And businessmen,</font>

691
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:04,325
<font face="Serif" size="18">they love to boast
about how successful they are</font>

692
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:07,194
<font face="Serif" size="18">and how much money they are making.</font>

693
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:11,799
<font face="Serif" size="18">And athletes, you know,
athletes are prideful, many of them.</font>

694
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:14,268
<font face="Serif" size="18">And they boast about the events</font>

695
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">that they’ve been great in
and that they’ve won.</font>

696
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:20,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">In fact, you know, it’s interesting to note</font>

697
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:23,277
<font face="Serif" size="18">that in the highly competitive sports world,</font>

698
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,547
<font face="Serif" size="18">there is an expression for great achievers.</font>

699
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:30,117
<font face="Serif" size="18">The expression is GOAT</font>

700
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,120
<font face="Serif" size="18">—G-O-A-T—</font>

701
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,090
<font face="Serif" size="18">greatest of all time.</font>

702
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,692
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can you imagine people thinking</font>

703
00:39:38,692 --> 00:39:42,630
<font face="Serif" size="18">that somehow they have been
the greatest of all time?</font>

704
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,434
<font face="Serif" size="18">When we hear the words
“greatest of all time,”</font>

705
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:49,403
<font face="Serif" size="18">only one person comes to mind.</font>

706
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:51,939
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was the greatest man who ever lived</font>

707
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:55,676
<font face="Serif" size="18">—truly the greatest of all time,
Jesus Christ.</font>

708
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:58,979
<font face="Serif" size="18">And his greatness had nothing to do</font>

709
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,149
<font face="Serif" size="18">with politics, business,</font>

710
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,652
<font face="Serif" size="18">or playing games.</font>

711
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,121
<font face="Serif" size="18">But it had everything to do</font>

712
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:11,525
<font face="Serif" size="18">with praising Jehovah and boasting</font>

713
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:13,894
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Jehovah God.</font>

714
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus knew the counsel that’s recorded</font>

715
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:19,533
<font face="Serif" size="18">at Jeremiah chapter 9,</font>

716
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,303
<font face="Serif" size="18">verses 23, 24.</font>

717
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:25,339
<font face="Serif" size="18">And this scripture, this text, is beautiful.</font>

718
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jeremiah 9:23, 24</font>

719
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:30,077
<font face="Serif" size="18">—it says:</font>

720
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:33,414
<font face="Serif" size="18">“This is what Jehovah says:</font>

721
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:38,052
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘Let not the wise man boast
about his wisdom;</font>

722
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:42,790
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘let not the mighty man boast
about his mightiness;</font>

723
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,495
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘and let not the rich man boast
about his riches.</font>

724
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:50,297
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘But let the one boasting</font>

725
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,833
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘boast about this:</font>

726
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:56,937
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘That he has insight and knowledge of me,</font>

727
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,673
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘that I am Jehovah,</font>

728
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:02,843
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘the One showing loyal love,</font>

729
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:06,347
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘justice, and righteousness in the earth,</font>

730
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:08,516
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘for in these things</font>

731
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:12,186
<font face="Serif" size="18">I take delight,’ declares Jehovah.”</font>

732
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">Isn’t that beautiful?</font>

733
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:16,257
<font face="Serif" size="18">So to boast in Jehovah really means</font>

734
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:19,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.</font>

735
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re proud to bear his name.</font>

736
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:24,765
<font face="Serif" size="18">We rejoice in his reputation.</font>

737
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:27,968
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’ve got it in the Scriptures,
and we can see it </font>

738
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,704
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the organization today.</font>

739
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:34,708
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Jehovah takes delight
when we boast in him</font>

740
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:38,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">—in his provisions, in his justice,</font>

741
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,782
<font face="Serif" size="18">in his promises, and in his loyal love.</font>

742
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,521
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you students of the 150th class of Gilead</font>

743
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:50,858
<font face="Serif" size="18">(students, soon-to-be graduates,
I should add),</font>

744
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:55,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">you’ve got a lot of reasons
to boast in Jehovah God.</font>

745
00:41:55,029 --> 00:41:59,967
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you know that throughout his ministry,
Jesus boasted in Jehovah.</font>

746
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:03,637
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you examine closely the Scriptures
and things that Jesus said,</font>

747
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:06,173
<font face="Serif" size="18">you’ll be able to see on many occasions</font>

748
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,709
<font face="Serif" size="18">how he boasted in Jehovah.</font>

749
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,811
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just to give you one example,</font>

750
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:14,081
<font face="Serif" size="18">remember when the rich young ruler
approached Jesus and he said:</font>

751
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:17,551
<font face="Serif" size="18">“[Oh,] Good Teacher”
to the Lord Jesus Christ?</font>

752
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:19,687
<font face="Serif" size="18">And what did Jesus say?</font>

753
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:23,123
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Why do you call me good?</font>

754
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:27,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nobody is good except one, God.”</font>

755
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:30,097
<font face="Serif" size="18">That was a wonderful boast</font>

756
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:33,567
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Jehovah God, glorifying him.</font>

757
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:35,869
<font face="Serif" size="18">So you students can boast in Jehovah</font>

758
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:37,972
<font face="Serif" size="18">(you’ve been doing it for a long time)</font>

759
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,174
<font face="Serif" size="18">because now you have</font>

760
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:43,978
<font face="Serif" size="18">the privilege of going out,
fulfilling an assignment,</font>

761
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:48,716
<font face="Serif" size="18">and showing how much
you really do rely on Jehovah God.</font>

762
00:42:48,716 --> 00:42:52,152
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can boast because you’ve experienced
what Jesus declared</font>

763
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,689
<font face="Serif" size="18">at John 8:32.</font>

764
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:59,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus said: “And you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free.”</font>

765
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:01,996
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, that’s something we all know.</font>

766
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,064
<font face="Serif" size="18">But don’t minimize it.</font>

767
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:07,935
<font face="Serif" size="18">Appreciate the freedom you have right now</font>

768
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,271
<font face="Serif" size="18">because you know the truth.</font>

769
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:13,574
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’ve been set free
from the lies of this world</font>

770
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:18,545
<font face="Serif" size="18">that hold people in bondage
about false beliefs in life and death.</font>

771
00:43:18,545 --> 00:43:20,881
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re free from human thinking that man</font>

772
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,417
<font face="Serif" size="18">is going to remedy
the problems of this old world,</font>

773
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:25,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">and we know they can’t do it.</font>

774
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:27,221
<font face="Serif" size="18">They haven’t got the wherewithal to do it.</font>

775
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:31,592
<font face="Serif" size="18">No man can really “direct his [own steps],”
not even a perfect man.</font>

776
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,462
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah can deliver his people too.</font>

777
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,234
<font face="Serif" size="18">Even where we’re under severe persecution,</font>

778
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:44,238
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah can intervene
whenever he sees fit to do so.</font>

779
00:43:45,406 --> 00:43:49,743
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can boast also in another thing
—that you are slaves of Jehovah.</font>

780
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:52,513
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, you’re in a unique position
because very few slaves</font>

781
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:55,215
<font face="Serif" size="18">are allowed to choose their master,</font>

782
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,217
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you’ve done it.</font>

783
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,453
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’ve chosen Jehovah God</font>

784
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:02,856
<font face="Serif" size="18">to be your Master and to be a slave to him.</font>

785
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:05,659
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you know that Jehovah is with you.</font>

786
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:10,164
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you’re happy, and you’re willing slaves
of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.</font>

787
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:13,300
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it’s a remarkable slavery, really,</font>

788
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,236
<font face="Serif" size="18">because no one has the freedom</font>

789
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,973
<font face="Serif" size="18">that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.</font>

790
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:23,777
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re so free and able to do so many things</font>

791
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,780
<font face="Serif" size="18">serving Jehovah but all the while</font>

792
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,051
<font face="Serif" size="18">enjoying the good life
that God has given to us.</font>

793
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:33,854
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can boast also in the brotherhood,</font>

794
00:44:33,854 --> 00:44:37,191
<font face="Serif" size="18">that you can gather together
in assemblies to praise Jehovah God.</font>

795
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you know Jesus’ words are true:</font>

796
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,762
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘Two or three are gathered in his name.</font>

797
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,197
<font face="Serif" size="18">There he is in our midst.’</font>

798
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:48,168
<font face="Serif" size="18">So whether it’s tens of thousands
gathered together at a big convention</font>

799
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:52,072
<font face="Serif" size="18">or two or three gathering together secretly,</font>

800
00:44:52,072 --> 00:44:55,109
<font face="Serif" size="18">you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.</font>

801
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:59,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can also boast in the great privilege
you have through prayer.</font>

802
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,815
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just think about it for a moment.</font>

803
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:06,320
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can talk to the almighty Creator
of the universe personally.</font>

804
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,556
<font face="Serif" size="18">That is really something quite remarkable.</font>

805
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,358
<font face="Serif" size="18">But that is a privilege we have,</font>

806
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:13,894
<font face="Serif" size="18">and we boast in the privilege we have</font>

807
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:17,231
<font face="Serif" size="18">of addressing Jehovah
and asking him for his help,</font>

808
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:20,467
<font face="Serif" size="18">for his spirit to guide us,
for his strength and protection.</font>

809
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">And there’s something else too
that I find fascinating</font>

810
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,073
<font face="Serif" size="18">that you can boast in.</font>

811
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:28,475
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can boast because you bear</font>

812
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,646
<font face="Serif" size="18">the fear-inspiring name
Jehovah’s Witnesses.</font>

813
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,648
<font face="Serif" size="18">Think about that.</font>

814
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,317
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re carrying Jehovah’s name.</font>

815
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:42,122
<font face="Serif" size="18">And how grateful, really,
we are that back in 1931</font>

816
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,992
<font face="Serif" size="18">the visible part of Jehovah’s organization</font>

817
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses!</font>

818
00:45:48,128 --> 00:45:50,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it’s not just the name of a religion.</font>

819
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:54,334
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s a description of what people do.</font>

820
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,504
<font face="Serif" size="18">They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.</font>

821
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,341
<font face="Serif" size="18">They are living Witnesses of the Creator.</font>

822
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,343
<font face="Serif" size="18">That is a privilege that we have,</font>

823
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,914
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that separates us
from all religion on the earth.</font>

824
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:09,917
<font face="Serif" size="18">And there’s no other religion
that wants that name anyhow.</font>

825
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:13,053
<font face="Serif" size="18">But we’re delighted that we have it.</font>

826
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:17,958
<font face="Serif" size="18">And they regret, perhaps a few,
that they didn’t listen to or adopt it.</font>

827
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:24,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">We are God’s name people,
and at 1 Chronicles 16:10,</font>

828
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,969
<font face="Serif" size="18">it says this: “Boast about his holy name.</font>

829
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:32,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let the hearts of those
seeking Jehovah rejoice.”</font>

830
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,442
<font face="Serif" size="18">And if you examine synonyms,</font>

831
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:38,979
<font face="Serif" size="18">“rejoice” is a synonym in certain cases</font>

832
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:42,950
<font face="Serif" size="18">for “boast”—to boast in Jehovah.</font>

833
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,586
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah</font>

834
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:48,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">has allowed you a very special privilege.</font>

835
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:52,226
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can see the unseen.</font>

836
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">Not all people can do that.</font>

837
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,597
<font face="Serif" size="18">The vision of many people in this world</font>

838
00:46:56,597 --> 00:47:00,367
<font face="Serif" size="18">is limited to just the physical
that they see before them,</font>

839
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,903
<font face="Serif" size="18">but they can’t see the unseen.</font>

840
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,239
<font face="Serif" size="18">I remember a man who said,</font>

841
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,641
<font face="Serif" size="18">“What has God ever done for me?”</font>

842
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">That poor man.</font>

843
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,247
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was blind—totally blind spiritually.</font>

844
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,084
<font face="Serif" size="18">He enjoyed food, drink,
the things the earth provides,</font>

845
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:20,954
<font face="Serif" size="18">but he couldn’t see
behind those physical things.</font>

846
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:24,858
<font face="Serif" size="18">He couldn’t see
that there had to be a wonderful Creator</font>

847
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:28,262
<font face="Serif" size="18">who provided all of these things for him.</font>

848
00:47:29,663 --> 00:47:32,666
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can see the unseen.</font>

849
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:36,169
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see Jesus Christ ruling
as King in the heavens.</font>

850
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:38,272
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see the new world that’s coming.</font>

851
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,807
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see the resurrection of the dead.</font>

852
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:44,511
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see the functioning
of Jehovah God’s holy spirit</font>

853
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,580
<font face="Serif" size="18">on his people today.</font>

854
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:50,050
<font face="Serif" size="18">Finally, you know very well</font>

855
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,154
<font face="Serif" size="18">that we’ve only touched
on a few things that you can boast in,</font>

856
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:58,492
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you’ll want to continue doing that
—boasting in Jehovah.</font>

857
00:47:58,492 --> 00:48:01,695
<font face="Serif" size="18">And right now, I know
(all of you students) you feel great.</font>

858
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:04,131
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’ve completed your course.
You’ve done it.</font>

859
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,800
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re graduating from Gilead School,</font>

860
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,736
<font face="Serif" size="18">and now the doors of future activity</font>

861
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:12,506
<font face="Serif" size="18">are swinging open to you.</font>

862
00:48:12,506 --> 00:48:16,176
<font face="Serif" size="18">So as you undertake your assignments,</font>

863
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:20,113
<font face="Serif" size="18">whatever and wherever they may be,</font>

864
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:22,883
<font face="Serif" size="18">do these things, please:</font>

865
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:24,952
<font face="Serif" size="18">Stay humble,</font>

866
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">be happy,</font>

867
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,089
<font face="Serif" size="18">and work hard.</font>

868
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,792
<font face="Serif" size="18">And always esteem highly</font>

869
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:34,828
<font face="Serif" size="18">the great honor and privilege you have</font>

870
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,431
<font face="Serif" size="18">to “boast in Jehovah.”</font>

871
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:47,441
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks.</font>

872
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,442
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thanks, Bill.</font>

873
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:51,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">As usual, we thoroughly enjoyed your talk.</font>

874
00:48:52,446 --> 00:48:55,549
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, our second prerecorded interview</font>

875
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:59,052
<font face="Serif" size="18">of a Gilead graduate now in his assignment</font>

876
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:03,123
<font face="Serif" size="18">takes us to Ecuador, South America.</font>

877
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:06,727
<font face="Serif" size="18">This brother serves
on the Branch Committee in Ecuador,</font>

878
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:11,732
<font face="Serif" size="18">and he graduated
from the 142nd class of Gilead.</font>

879
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,801
<font face="Serif" size="18">Notice as he explains</font>

880
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">(notice) the positive impact</font>

881
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,439
<font face="Serif" size="18">that Gilead graduates had on him</font>

882
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:21,475
<font face="Serif" size="18">from his childhood</font>

883
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,977
<font face="Serif" size="18">and how his training while at Gilead</font>

884
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:28,281
<font face="Serif" size="18">helped him to appreciate
what is truly important.</font>

885
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother and Sister Tapia
will be going back to Ecuador.</font>

886
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">Gilead training is a beautiful way</font>

887
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,693
<font face="Serif" size="18">that Jehovah is using divine education</font>

888
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:41,228
<font face="Serif" size="18">to train people</font>

889
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,630
<font face="Serif" size="18">—not only for their benefit.</font>

890
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,098
<font face="Serif" size="18">By having Gilead graduates</font>

891
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">all around the world,</font>

892
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,202
<font face="Serif" size="18">we are sharing the impact of this school</font>

893
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:51,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">on the brothers and sisters who are working</font>

894
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:54,307
<font face="Serif" size="18">with these students and future graduates.</font>

895
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:55,942
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was Gilead missionaries</font>

896
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,145
<font face="Serif" size="18">who first introduced the truth to my parents</font>

897
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">and helped them to the point of baptism.</font>

898
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,650
<font face="Serif" size="18">So I have very pleasant memories</font>

899
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">of Gilead graduates
being around my home since childhood.</font>

900
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,757
<font face="Serif" size="18">The greatest legacy
I received through my Gilead training</font>

901
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,759
<font face="Serif" size="18">is the privilege of getting to know</font>

902
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,729
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah’s beautiful personality more deeply.</font>

903
00:50:15,729 --> 00:50:18,331
<font face="Serif" size="18">I have been studying
the Bible since childhood,</font>

904
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:21,768
<font face="Serif" size="18">but doing so with the help
of the Gilead instructors</font>

905
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">really helped me to make connections</font>

906
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,907
<font face="Serif" size="18">that I had never put together before.</font>

907
00:50:26,907 --> 00:50:29,142
<font face="Serif" size="18">You don’t go to Gilead to learn abilities,</font>

908
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:32,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">which can sometimes overshadow
spiritual qualities.</font>

909
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:36,416
<font face="Serif" size="18">Instead, a very important part
of Gilead training</font>

910
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,152
<font face="Serif" size="18">is the study of Christ’s personality.</font>

911
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you know, Jesus is mostly remembered</font>

912
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:43,757
<font face="Serif" size="18">not so much for his abilities</font>

913
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:46,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">but for how he perfectly reflected</font>

914
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,762
<font face="Serif" size="18">the beautiful qualities of his father.</font>

915
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">By getting to know Jehovah and Jesus better,</font>

916
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,702
<font face="Serif" size="18">I was able to better see
where I need to improve.</font>

917
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,271
<font face="Serif" size="18">Of course, it can be discouraging at times</font>

918
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">to not always act as they do,</font>

919
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:01,875
<font face="Serif" size="18">but that has helped me</font>

920
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:05,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">to have the proper perspective
and to rely on Jehovah,</font>

921
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:08,915
<font face="Serif" size="18">begging him for his guidance
while waiting for his help.</font>

922
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:12,185
<font face="Serif" size="18">One of the best lessons
I took away from Gilead is</font>

923
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:17,190
<font face="Serif" size="18">that people are more important
than tasks or deadlines.</font>

924
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,027
<font face="Serif" size="18">People are the reason for our assignment,</font>

925
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,998
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that is why I need to show my love
to my brothers and sisters.</font>

926
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:29,336
<font face="Serif" size="18">Honestly, I don’t feel at all qualified
for this assignment,</font>

927
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,973
<font face="Serif" size="18">but I have learned
that if Jehovah assigns us a certain task,</font>

928
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:36,309
<font face="Serif" size="18">for sure he will give us
what we need to accomplish it.</font>

929
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:43,583
<font face="Serif" size="18">That was very nice.</font>

930
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,085
<font face="Serif" size="18">We certainly appreciate it.</font>

931
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:49,189
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, we have one
of the Gilead instructors next,</font>

932
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,224
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother James Cauthon.</font>

933
00:51:53,093 --> 00:51:55,595
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he’s chosen as his subject</font>

934
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:58,398
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Thriving in the Trenches.”</font>

935
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:04,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">Located in the western Pacific Ocean,</font>

936
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:09,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">the Mariana Trench
is the deepest known location on earth.</font>

937
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:12,546
<font face="Serif" size="18">To help you get an idea of its depth,</font>

938
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,247
<font face="Serif" size="18">imagine that you could stack</font>

939
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,949
<font face="Serif" size="18">the Empire State Building</font>

940
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:17,984
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the trench.</font>

941
00:52:17,984 --> 00:52:21,655
<font face="Serif" size="18">It would take 25 such buildings to go</font>

942
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:25,091
<font face="Serif" size="18">from the bottom of the trench
before you would reach sea level.</font>

943
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:30,230
<font face="Serif" size="18">It is also one of the deadliest places
on earth.</font>

944
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why is that?</font>

945
00:52:31,832 --> 00:52:34,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">In a word—pressure.</font>

946
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,070
<font face="Serif" size="18">The crushing pressure, water pressure,</font>

947
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,808
<font face="Serif" size="18">on the floor of the trench
is more than eight tons per square inch.</font>

948
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:43,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, to give you some idea,</font>

949
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,411
<font face="Serif" size="18">that would be the equivalent</font>

950
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,415
<font face="Serif" size="18">of having about 50 jumbo jets</font>

951
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,450
<font face="Serif" size="18">on top of you.</font>

952
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:55,522
<font face="Serif" size="18">Surely no life could live in that trench.</font>

953
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:58,058
<font face="Serif" size="18">At least that’s what scientists thought.</font>

954
00:52:58,825 --> 00:53:00,827
<font face="Serif" size="18">But they were wrong.</font>

955
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,829
<font face="Serif" size="18">When they finally developed a submersible</font>

956
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:05,198
<font face="Serif" size="18">that would take them down into the trench,</font>

957
00:53:05,198 --> 00:53:09,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">they found life teeming</font>

958
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">—and not just surviving but thriving.</font>

959
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,043
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, how is that possible?</font>

960
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:21,615
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s possible, friends,
because Jehovah, our Creator,</font>

961
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,085
<font face="Serif" size="18">knows how to deal with pressure.</font>

962
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:28,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.</font>

963
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:32,192
<font face="Serif" size="18">And this is a fact
that should be comforting to all of us.</font>

964
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:33,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why?</font>

965
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because the pressure</font>

966
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:38,498
<font face="Serif" size="18">in this system of things is increasing</font>

967
00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:41,268
<font face="Serif" size="18">—strain, stress, anxiety—</font>

968
00:53:41,268 --> 00:53:43,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">for all people at all levels.</font>

969
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,405
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the Bible tells us</font>

970
00:53:45,405 --> 00:53:49,342
<font face="Serif" size="18">that these pressures are likely
to increase in the near future.</font>

971
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:51,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">But the good news is</font>

972
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:55,715
<font face="Serif" size="18">that Jehovah does more than
just equip his servants to survive.</font>

973
00:53:55,715 --> 00:53:59,719
<font face="Serif" size="18">He can actually make one thrive.</font>

974
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,721
<font face="Serif" size="18">Here’s an example.</font>

975
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:04,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">Try this on for pressure.</font>

976
00:54:05,258 --> 00:54:08,528
<font face="Serif" size="18">You’re surrounded by men who hate you.</font>

977
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:12,299
<font face="Serif" size="18">In addition to hunting you down
with a view to taking your life,</font>

978
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:16,903
<font face="Serif" size="18">they’ve spread slander and lies
about you everywhere.</font>

979
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:20,073
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your name has become a reproach.</font>

980
00:54:20,073 --> 00:54:24,411
<font face="Serif" size="18">When people see you coming,
they turn and run the other way</font>

981
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:26,913
<font face="Serif" size="18">because they feel that your time is short</font>

982
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:31,217
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they don’t want to be caught
in the crosshairs.</font>

983
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:35,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">Wherever you look,
it seems like terror is waiting for you.</font>

984
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:40,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">And as a result of these problems,
you’re struggling with depression.</font>

985
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,896
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your own sins are staring you in the face.</font>

986
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:45,665
<font face="Serif" size="18">The whole experience
has taken a toll on your health.</font>

987
00:54:45,665 --> 00:54:46,833
<font face="Serif" size="18">You can’t sleep.</font>

988
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,435
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your stamina is shot.</font>

989
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:50,770
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your body is wasting away.</font>

990
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:55,942
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, that was David’s situation,</font>

991
00:54:55,942 --> 00:55:00,280
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you can read about it at Psalm 31:10-13.</font>

992
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:04,384
<font face="Serif" size="18">The pressure was real
—no question about it.</font>

993
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:09,356
<font face="Serif" size="18">David’s feelings were real
—no question about that.</font>

994
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:12,492
<font face="Serif" size="18">But something else was very real.</font>

995
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:15,362
<font face="Serif" size="18">And that was Jehovah.</font>

996
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:20,333
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so Jehovah
was where David would turn to.</font>

997
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:24,437
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s turn to his words in Psalm 31.</font>

998
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:30,276
<font face="Serif" size="18">Psalm 31—and note his humble prayer</font>

999
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:32,278
<font face="Serif" size="18">beginning in verse 14.</font>

1000
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:37,083
<font face="Serif" size="18">He said: “But I trust in you, O Jehovah,</font>

1001
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,453
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I declare: ‘You are my God.’</font>

1002
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:42,455
<font face="Serif" size="18">“My days are in your hand.</font>

1003
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:46,593
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Rescue me from the hand of my enemies
and from those persecuting me.</font>

1004
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,496
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Make your face shine upon your servant.</font>

1005
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:52,365
<font face="Serif" size="18">Save me by your loyal love.”</font>

1006
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:57,103
<font face="Serif" size="18">David’s life experiences</font>

1007
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,006
<font face="Serif" size="18">had taught him the value of turning to God</font>

1008
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:03,076
<font face="Serif" size="18">and pouring out his heart in times of trial.</font>

1009
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:07,580
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he absolutely knew that prayer,</font>

1010
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:11,284
<font face="Serif" size="18">coupled with implicit trust and patience,</font>

1011
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">would always bring Jehovah’s blessing.</font>

1012
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:19,125
<font face="Serif" size="18">And you see, friends,
the key to not just surviving</font>

1013
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,228
<font face="Serif" size="18">but thriving under extreme pressure</font>

1014
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:25,265
<font face="Serif" size="18">is to have the internal pressure</font>

1015
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:28,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">equal to the external.</font>

1016
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,603
<font face="Serif" size="18">And when this is true,</font>

1017
00:56:30,603 --> 00:56:35,041
<font face="Serif" size="18">there is no amount of pressure
that can crush you.</font>

1018
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,377
<font face="Serif" size="18">So in a spiritual sense,</font>

1019
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:41,681
<font face="Serif" size="18">David received the internal fortitude
or, as some say,</font>

1020
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:44,050
<font face="Serif" size="18">“the intestinal fortitude,”</font>

1021
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,419
<font face="Serif" size="18">meaning “the courage and the strength</font>

1022
00:56:46,419 --> 00:56:50,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">that would make him equal
to the pressure weighing in on him.”</font>

1023
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:53,460
<font face="Serif" size="18">And how do we know that he received that?</font>

1024
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,463
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, let’s go back to Psalm 31
for just a moment.</font>

1025
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,267
<font face="Serif" size="18">If you look in verse 21, notice now</font>

1026
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,603
<font face="Serif" size="18">the change.</font>

1027
00:57:03,603 --> 00:57:06,606
<font face="Serif" size="18">He says: “May Jehovah be praised,</font>

1028
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:11,111
<font face="Serif" size="18">“for in a wonderful way,
he has shown his loyal love to me</font>

1029
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:13,346
<font face="Serif" size="18">in a besieged city.”</font>

1030
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,815
<font face="Serif" size="18">And then in verse 23:</font>

1031
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:19,018
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!</font>

1032
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah protects the faithful.”</font>

1033
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,223
<font face="Serif" size="18">And finally in verse 24:</font>

1034
00:57:23,223 --> 00:57:26,826
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,</font>

1035
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:30,597
<font face="Serif" size="18">all you who are waiting for Jehovah.”</font>

1036
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:36,569
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, you see, David</font>

1037
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:39,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">received an answer to his prayer</font>

1038
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,676
<font face="Serif" size="18">—his prayer coupled with his faith</font>

1039
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,678
<font face="Serif" size="18">and his patience.</font>

1040
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:47,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was waiting on Jehovah.</font>

1041
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,418
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Jehovah helped him not only to survive
but to thrive.</font>

1042
00:57:52,418 --> 00:57:55,822
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he added joy to David</font>

1043
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:59,692
<font face="Serif" size="18">because David went on
to find joy and happiness</font>

1044
00:57:59,692 --> 00:58:03,396
<font face="Serif" size="18">in his responsibilities and privileges.</font>

1045
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,398
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, what do we learn?</font>

1046
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:09,402
<font face="Serif" size="18">(1) David was able to face the pressure</font>

1047
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:13,473
<font face="Serif" size="18">because he had
an unshakable faith in Jehovah,</font>

1048
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:17,177
<font face="Serif" size="18">(2) David’s relationship with Jehovah</font>

1049
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:21,447
<font face="Serif" size="18">brought him the patience to wait on God,</font>

1050
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:25,018
<font face="Serif" size="18">and (3) when a loyal servant of God</font>

1051
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:27,220
<font face="Serif" size="18">humbly turns to Jehovah for help,</font>

1052
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,623
<font face="Serif" size="18">it is Jehovah’s own loyal love</font>

1053
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:34,060
<font face="Serif" size="18">that has the effect
of equalizing the pressure.</font>

1054
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:38,565
<font face="Serif" size="18">And, you know, there’s something else.</font>

1055
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:43,369
<font face="Serif" size="18">David’s experience in the trench
 reached further than he ever knew.</font>

1056
00:58:44,837 --> 00:58:48,641
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,</font>

1057
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:52,512
<font face="Serif" size="18">cited words from Psalm 31.</font>

1058
00:58:52,512 --> 00:58:57,517
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jeremiah, who had
many trialsome times in his life,</font>

1059
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:01,955
<font face="Serif" size="18">often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.</font>

1060
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:06,326
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Jesus Christ himself,
the very Son of God—</font>

1061
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:08,628
<font face="Serif" size="18">His final words from the stake</font>

1062
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:12,098
<font face="Serif" size="18">were a quotation from Psalm 31:5.</font>

1063
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:15,935
<font face="Serif" size="18">So Jesus must have meditated
on this many times.</font>

1064
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:19,272
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so, friends, like David, Jonah, Jeremiah,</font>

1065
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:22,442
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus, and many, many others</font>

1066
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:24,744
<font face="Serif" size="18">—they all trusted in Jehovah,</font>

1067
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:29,616
<font face="Serif" size="18">and Jehovah never failed
to make them equal to the pressure.</font>

1068
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:32,252
<font face="Serif" size="18">He’ll do the same for you.</font>

1069
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,687
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so in conclusion,</font>

1070
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:38,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">you see, it really doesn’t matter</font>

1071
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,293
<font face="Serif" size="18">how great the pressure is.</font>

1072
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:43,896
<font face="Serif" size="18">It only matters where the pressure lies.</font>

1073
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:47,500
<font face="Serif" size="18">Do not let it come between you</font>

1074
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:51,170
<font face="Serif" size="18">and Jehovah
and your worship and service.</font>

1075
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,773
<font face="Serif" size="18">Don’t let it come between you,</font>

1076
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:56,843
<font face="Serif" size="18">because then the external pressure</font>

1077
00:59:56,843 --> 01:00:00,413
<font face="Serif" size="18">will only continue to move you closer</font>

1078
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">to your heavenly Father.</font>

1079
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:07,553
<font face="Serif" size="18">The life that flourishes
in the Mariana Trench gives</font>

1080
01:00:07,553 --> 01:00:10,556
<font face="Serif" size="18">a positive example, a beautiful example,</font>

1081
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:13,660
<font face="Serif" size="18">of Jehovah’s limitless ability
to help his creation</font>

1082
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,662
<font face="Serif" size="18">deal with pressure.</font>

1083
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:17,997
<font face="Serif" size="18">Prayer, trust, and patience</font>

1084
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:21,634
<font face="Serif" size="18">will always be rewarded by Jehovah.</font>

1085
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:24,304
<font face="Serif" size="18">Relief will come.</font>

1086
01:00:24,304 --> 01:00:27,073
<font face="Serif" size="18">So remain close to your heavenly Father,</font>

1087
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:30,209
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you will not just survive</font>

1088
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,212
<font face="Serif" size="18">the pressure in the trench</font>

1089
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,948
<font face="Serif" size="18">but you will thrive spiritually.</font>

1090
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:47,126
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you, Brother Cauthon,
for your nice, insightful comments</font>

1091
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:49,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">—much appreciated.</font>

1092
01:00:49,128 --> 01:00:51,798
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, our third interview involves a brother</font>

1093
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:54,701
<font face="Serif" size="18">who serves as a member
of the Branch Committee</font>

1094
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:56,903
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Sri Lanka.</font>

1095
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:01,874
<font face="Serif" size="18">He graduated from the 146th class of Gilead</font>

1096
01:01:01,874 --> 01:01:04,644
<font face="Serif" size="18">—so just four classes back.</font>

1097
01:01:04,644 --> 01:01:06,779
<font face="Serif" size="18">Listen carefully as he explains</font>

1098
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:11,751
<font face="Serif" size="18">how Gilead training helped him
to see things about his personality</font>

1099
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,020
<font face="Serif" size="18">that he needed to refine</font>

1100
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:18,491
<font face="Serif" size="18">to become a stabilizing
and strengthening influence</font>

1101
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,493
<font face="Serif" size="18">in his branch territory.</font>

1102
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,765
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother and Sister Sivakumaran
will be returning to Sri Lanka.</font>

1103
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:30,870
<font face="Serif" size="18">In Gilead, the wonderful thing</font>

1104
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,739
<font face="Serif" size="18">is that you get to learn
from the beginning</font>

1105
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:34,607
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jehovah’s dealings with humankind,</font>

1106
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,075
<font face="Serif" size="18">that vast history.</font>

1107
01:01:36,075 --> 01:01:37,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">Learning that is humbling.</font>

1108
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:41,414
<font face="Serif" size="18">How tiny I am</font>

1109
01:01:41,414 --> 01:01:43,449
<font face="Serif" size="18">and the small role that I play</font>

1110
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,818
<font face="Serif" size="18">in Jehovah’s organization are a realization!</font>

1111
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:50,189
<font face="Serif" size="18">Before going to Gilead,
I thought I was a loving person,</font>

1112
01:01:50,189 --> 01:01:53,159
<font face="Serif" size="18">because we always think
we want to be loving people.</font>

1113
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">But during Gilead,
it was made aware to me</font>

1114
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,332
<font face="Serif" size="18">that I had a spiritual blind spot.</font>

1115
01:01:59,332 --> 01:02:02,969
<font face="Serif" size="18">There were brothers and sisters
that I didn’t really notice before,</font>

1116
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,840
<font face="Serif" size="18">and that kind of taught me
an important lesson.</font>

1117
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,910
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s not about giving talks,</font>

1118
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,081
<font face="Serif" size="18">but really it’s personal attention
that brothers need.</font>

1119
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">So I need to give them my time,</font>

1120
01:02:17,216 --> 01:02:19,318
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I need to help them understand</font>

1121
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,955
<font face="Serif" size="18">that Jehovah loves them very much.</font>

1122
01:02:22,955 --> 01:02:27,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">You know, one word that stands out
throughout the training is “mercy.”</font>

1123
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,295
<font face="Serif" size="18">Israel made many mistakes,</font>

1124
01:02:29,295 --> 01:02:31,597
<font face="Serif" size="18">but Jehovah never picked on them
for their mistakes.</font>

1125
01:02:31,597 --> 01:02:35,268
<font face="Serif" size="18">He just wanted them to come back to him,
and that was a lovely lesson.</font>

1126
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:39,639
<font face="Serif" size="18">As an overseer,
I need to ask a question that always,</font>

1127
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:41,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">you know, rings in my my ear,</font>

1128
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:45,378
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘Am I going to criticize,
or am I going to commend?’</font>

1129
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:48,581
<font face="Serif" size="18">Just to give you an example,
before going to Gilead,</font>

1130
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:52,251
<font face="Serif" size="18">as a home overseer
I was strict</font>

1131
01:02:52,251 --> 01:02:55,488
<font face="Serif" size="18">and came across stingy,
to be honest.</font>

1132
01:02:55,488 --> 01:02:58,624
<font face="Serif" size="18">But during Gilead,
it was made well aware to me</font>

1133
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:00,426
<font face="Serif" size="18">that I need to change.</font>

1134
01:03:00,426 --> 01:03:02,662
<font face="Serif" size="18">I need to be more generous,</font>

1135
01:03:02,662 --> 01:03:04,897
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I need to be merciful.</font>

1136
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:07,600
<font face="Serif" size="18">I vividly remember that one instructor said:</font>

1137
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,637
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Saying no to everything can be addictive,</font>

1138
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:13,639
<font face="Serif" size="18">and it makes for an easy way out.”</font>

1139
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:18,344
<font face="Serif" size="18">But we were admonished
to say yes whenever we can</font>

1140
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:20,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">and to help the brothers.</font>

1141
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:24,283
<font face="Serif" size="18">Summing up Gilead,
I can’t do better than Jesus.</font>

1142
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:27,753
<font face="Serif" size="18">Love Jehovah; love people</font>

1143
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:29,856
<font face="Serif" size="18">—that’s the whole training of Gilead.</font>

1144
01:03:29,856 --> 01:03:31,891
<font face="Serif" size="18">And some of my feelings</font>

1145
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:36,295
<font face="Serif" size="18">every time I think about Gilead</font>

1146
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:40,600
<font face="Serif" size="18">are that I have a long way to go
to put all those details into practice</font>

1147
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">and to change myself to fit Jehovah.</font>

1148
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:46,973
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, yeah, I have a long way to go,
so I’m working on it.</font>

1149
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:58,384
<font face="Serif" size="18">So we pray that all
of you soon-to-be graduates</font>

1150
01:03:58,384 --> 01:04:01,153
<font face="Serif" size="18">examine yourself to ensure</font>

1151
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:05,258
<font face="Serif" size="18">that you’ll have a strengthening effect
on the brotherhood.</font>

1152
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,461
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was nice, the humble expressions
he shared with us.</font>

1153
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:12,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now let’s turn our attention
to another one of the Gilead instructors</font>

1154
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:16,936
<font face="Serif" size="18">and a helper to the Teaching Committee,
Mark Noumair.</font>

1155
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,472
<font face="Serif" size="18">The title of his talk is</font>

1156
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:24,243
<font face="Serif" size="18">“‘I Cling to You; You Hold on to Me.’”</font>

1157
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,245
<font face="Serif" size="18">Brother Noumair.</font>

1158
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:32,718
<font face="Serif" size="18">In this talk, we want you to understand</font>

1159
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:37,490
<font face="Serif" size="18">the sustaining power of loyal love.</font>

1160
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:40,459
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because it is this quality, loyal love,</font>

1161
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,528
<font face="Serif" size="18">and its power</font>

1162
01:04:42,528 --> 01:04:46,032
<font face="Serif" size="18">that will help you face future trials</font>

1163
01:04:46,032 --> 01:04:50,469
<font face="Serif" size="18">and challenges with confidence in Jehovah.</font>

1164
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,639
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, you perhaps remember the definition</font>

1165
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,409
<font face="Serif" size="18">of loyal love from a written review.</font>

1166
01:04:56,409 --> 01:05:00,680
<font face="Serif" size="18">But it’s this: It is love motivated</font>

1167
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,784
<font face="Serif" size="18">by a strong commitment and a deep attachment.</font>

1168
01:05:04,784 --> 01:05:06,986
<font face="Serif" size="18">And here’s how King David described</font>

1169
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:11,257
<font face="Serif" size="18">the loyal love that existed
between him and Jehovah.</font>

1170
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:14,160
<font face="Serif" size="18">He said at Psalm 63:8:</font>

1171
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,529
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I cling to you;</font>

1172
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:20,499
<font face="Serif" size="18">your right hand keeps fast hold on me.”</font>

1173
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,269
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, this is loyal love,</font>

1174
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:25,271
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘I cling to you.</font>

1175
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:28,240
<font face="Serif" size="18">You hold on to me.’</font>

1176
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,977
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, in the first century
—a woman—</font>

1177
01:05:30,977 --> 01:05:33,679
<font face="Serif" size="18">a woman who set an outstanding example</font>

1178
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,817
<font face="Serif" size="18">of clinging to Jehovah is Anna.</font>

1179
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:40,453
<font face="Serif" size="18">How so?
Let’s find out.</font>

1180
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:43,556
<font face="Serif" size="18">We open our Bibles to Luke chapter 2.</font>

1181
01:05:43,556 --> 01:05:46,726
<font face="Serif" size="18">We’re going to read verses 36 and 37</font>

1182
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:51,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">and see what lesson
we can learn and apply to you:</font>

1183
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,468
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Now there was a prophetess,</font>

1184
01:05:55,468 --> 01:05:58,971
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Anna the daughter
of Phanuel, of Asher’s tribe.</font>

1185
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:01,207
<font face="Serif" size="18">“This woman was well along in years</font>

1186
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:05,544
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and had lived with her husband
for seven years after they were married,</font>

1187
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:09,382
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and she was a widow now 84 years old.</font>

1188
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">“She was never missing from the temple,</font>

1189
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,954
<font face="Serif" size="18">“rendering sacred service night and day</font>

1190
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:17,590
<font face="Serif" size="18">with fasting and supplications.”</font>

1191
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,792
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, here we have it.</font>

1192
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:23,629
<font face="Serif" size="18">Everything we know about Anna is right here.</font>

1193
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:25,931
<font face="Serif" size="18">Luke recorded it.</font>

1194
01:06:25,931 --> 01:06:28,534
<font face="Serif" size="18">She was 84 years old</font>

1195
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:31,771
<font face="Serif" size="18">when Luke introduces her to us.</font>

1196
01:06:31,771 --> 01:06:36,475
<font face="Serif" size="18">Likely, she hadn’t lived long enough
to become a follower of Jesus,</font>

1197
01:06:36,475 --> 01:06:39,011
<font face="Serif" size="18">to be anointed with holy spirit,</font>

1198
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:42,148
<font face="Serif" size="18">or to enjoy preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.</font>

1199
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:44,216
<font face="Serif" size="18">That’s it.</font>

1200
01:06:44,216 --> 01:06:47,887
<font face="Serif" size="18"><i>If</i></font><font face="Serif" size="18">  we stop right there.</font>

1201
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:49,989
<font face="Serif" size="18">But what if we don’t?</font>

1202
01:06:49,989 --> 01:06:52,358
<font face="Serif" size="18">What if we dig deeper?</font>

1203
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:55,094
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will we learn that will help you?</font>

1204
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,096
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, let’s do that.</font>

1205
01:06:57,863 --> 01:07:01,734
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anna was born about 86 B.C.E.</font>

1206
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:06,038
<font face="Serif" size="18">When she was 23 years old,</font>

1207
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:10,776
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jerusalem was filled
with violence and divisions.</font>

1208
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,713
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jewish leaders
such as the Maccabees are at war.</font>

1209
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:17,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">Roman forces under the leadership
of a soldier named Pompey</font>

1210
01:07:17,383 --> 01:07:20,252
<font face="Serif" size="18">came to restore order, and in the process,</font>

1211
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:24,924
<font face="Serif" size="18">some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.</font>

1212
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:28,394
<font face="Serif" size="18">It is possible that Anna’s husband</font>

1213
01:07:28,394 --> 01:07:30,463
<font face="Serif" size="18">was one of these victims.</font>

1214
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:34,700
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then when Anna was 47 years old,</font>

1215
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,603
<font face="Serif" size="18">the Romans appointed Herod as king of Judea.</font>

1216
01:07:37,603 --> 01:07:39,305
<font face="Serif" size="18">Herod?</font>

1217
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,474
<font face="Serif" size="18">This man was not a descendant of David.</font>

1218
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,476
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was not even an Israelite.</font>

1219
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,511
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was an Edomite.</font>

1220
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:49,849
<font face="Serif" size="18">The Edomites
were sworn enemies of true worship.</font>

1221
01:07:49,849 --> 01:07:54,553
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, on top of that,
the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders</font>

1222
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:59,558
<font face="Serif" size="18">made life hard for people,
including widows like Anna.</font>

1223
01:07:59,558 --> 01:08:03,829
<font face="Serif" size="18">So now Anna watches
as Jehovah’s “house of prayer,”</font>

1224
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:08,467
<font face="Serif" size="18">the place she cherished,
became “a cave of robbers.”</font>

1225
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:12,538
<font face="Serif" size="18">Pure worship is withering on the vine.</font>

1226
01:08:12,538 --> 01:08:14,540
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will Anna do?</font>

1227
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,609
<font face="Serif" size="18">She could have been stumbled.</font>

1228
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:21,447
<font face="Serif" size="18">She could have reasoned:
‘I supported true worship all my life.</font>

1229
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:25,918
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘I believed the Messiah would come
and the prophecies would come.</font>

1230
01:08:25,918 --> 01:08:27,987
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘I go to the temple every day.</font>

1231
01:08:27,987 --> 01:08:31,690
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘I’ve done everything right,
but things have only gotten worse.</font>

1232
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:36,128
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘God let my husband die;
an Edomite is rebuilding the temple.</font>

1233
01:08:36,128 --> 01:08:38,130
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘What’s happening?</font>

1234
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,332
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘Has Jehovah left us?</font>

1235
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:42,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">Should I leave too?’</font>

1236
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:46,739
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anna could have given up,
walked away, became bitter.</font>

1237
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:48,741
<font face="Serif" size="18">But she didn’t.</font>

1238
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:51,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">Why? Why?</font>

1239
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:54,647
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was the roots of her loyal love,</font>

1240
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:56,982
<font face="Serif" size="18">that sustaining power of loyal love.</font>

1241
01:08:56,982 --> 01:09:00,119
<font face="Serif" size="18">It went deep, and it wrapped around Jehovah.</font>

1242
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:03,122
<font face="Serif" size="18">And she had the power to keep clinging to him</font>

1243
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:05,624
<font face="Serif" size="18">under those circumstances.</font>

1244
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:09,662
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anna was determined to serve Jehovah
to the best of her ability.</font>

1245
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:11,664
<font face="Serif" size="18">What did she do?</font>

1246
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:15,901
<font face="Serif" size="18">Again, looking at verse 37:</font>

1247
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:19,238
<font face="Serif" size="18">“She was never missing from the temple,</font>

1248
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">“[She was in the right place.]</font>

1249
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:26,645
<font face="Serif" size="18">“rendering sacred service night and day</font>

1250
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:29,315
<font face="Serif" size="18">“[doing the right thing]</font>

1251
01:09:29,315 --> 01:09:31,851
<font face="Serif" size="18">“with fasting and supplications</font>

1252
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:34,587
<font face="Serif" size="18">[with the right attitude].”</font>

1253
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,723
<font face="Serif" size="18">She was doing the right thing</font>

1254
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:41,260
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the right place with the right attitude.</font>

1255
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,464
<font face="Serif" size="18">Nothing could stop
this seemingly fragile servant of God</font>

1256
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:48,467
<font face="Serif" size="18">from clinging to her closest Friend, Jehovah.</font>

1257
01:09:49,735 --> 01:09:52,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">In effect, Anna was saying,</font>

1258
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:56,175
<font face="Serif" size="18">“I cling to you, Jehovah.”</font>

1259
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:59,345
<font face="Serif" size="18">And her loyal love was noticed.</font>

1260
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,415
<font face="Serif" size="18">Chapter 2 and verse 38</font>

1261
01:10:03,415 --> 01:10:06,552
<font face="Serif" size="18">reveals that Anna was present</font>

1262
01:10:06,552 --> 01:10:10,422
<font face="Serif" size="18">when the baby Jesus
was brought to the temple.</font>

1263
01:10:10,422 --> 01:10:15,227
<font face="Serif" size="18">And when she saw that baby,
what did she begin to do in verse 38?</font>

1264
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:19,531
<font face="Serif" size="18">It says: “She came near
and [she] began giving thanks to God</font>

1265
01:10:19,531 --> 01:10:22,501
<font face="Serif" size="18">“and speaking about the child
to all who were waiting</font>

1266
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:25,037
<font face="Serif" size="18">for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”</font>

1267
01:10:25,037 --> 01:10:27,940
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can you sense her joy?</font>

1268
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">Can you feel the joy she had
at seeing and, perhaps, even holding</font>

1269
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,946
<font face="Serif" size="18">that little baby, the future Messiah?</font>

1270
01:10:33,946 --> 01:10:36,649
<font face="Serif" size="18">This was something that this elderly woman</font>

1271
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:40,185
<font face="Serif" size="18">had never expected in her lifetime.</font>

1272
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:43,856
<font face="Serif" size="18">The child in front of her was proof</font>

1273
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:46,959
<font face="Serif" size="18">—tangible proof, concrete evidence—</font>

1274
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:51,497
<font face="Serif" size="18">that Jehovah had not abandoned his people.</font>

1275
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,234
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he did not abandon Anna.</font>

1276
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:59,638
<font face="Serif" size="18">So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah</font>

1277
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:04,643
<font face="Serif" size="18">but Jehovah held on to her and</font>

1278
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:08,480
<font face="Serif" size="18">—an<i>d  </i></font><font face="Serif" size="18">rewarded her.</font>

1279
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,483
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is loyal love.</font>

1280
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:15,921
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anna’s faithful record</font>

1281
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:18,457
<font face="Serif" size="18">is so well-known</font>

1282
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:22,928
<font face="Serif" size="18">that some 50 years later,
50 years later or so,</font>

1283
01:11:22,928 --> 01:11:25,965
<font face="Serif" size="18">Luke was compelled to write about her.</font>

1284
01:11:25,965 --> 01:11:28,033
<font face="Serif" size="18">Where did he get his information?</font>

1285
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,868
<font face="Serif" size="18">Who did he talk to?</font>

1286
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:33,339
<font face="Serif" size="18">Did he talk to Mary or interview her
or some of the older ones?</font>

1287
01:11:33,339 --> 01:11:35,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘There was this woman, Anna.
She was at the temple.</font>

1288
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,743
<font face="Serif" size="18">She would never leave.’</font>

1289
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:39,745
<font face="Serif" size="18">We don’t know.</font>

1290
01:11:39,745 --> 01:11:44,383
<font face="Serif" size="18">But what we do know is
that Jehovah inspired Luke</font>

1291
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:48,654
<font face="Serif" size="18">to record and to document
her life in His Word</font>

1292
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:52,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">so that we could be taught lessons.</font>

1293
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,928
<font face="Serif" size="18">And here we are some 2,000 years later,</font>

1294
01:11:55,928 --> 01:11:59,298
<font face="Serif" size="18">and we are using her life as an example</font>

1295
01:11:59,298 --> 01:12:02,668
<font face="Serif" size="18">of commitment and unbreakable integrity</font>

1296
01:12:02,668 --> 01:12:04,670
<font face="Serif" size="18">for you students to imitate.</font>

1297
01:12:06,105 --> 01:12:09,608
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, what can you learn from Anna’s example?</font>

1298
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:15,614
<font face="Serif" size="18">You may suffer loss of one kind or another.</font>

1299
01:12:15,614 --> 01:12:19,718
<font face="Serif" size="18">You will come face-to-face
with the imperfections of others.</font>

1300
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:22,254
<font face="Serif" size="18">Your feelings may get hurt,</font>

1301
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,524
<font face="Serif" size="18">you might find yourself coping
with an unexpected change</font>

1302
01:12:25,524 --> 01:12:28,427
<font face="Serif" size="18">in your life that is not pleasant,</font>

1303
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,296
<font face="Serif" size="18">or you may feel that you’re a victim</font>

1304
01:12:31,296 --> 01:12:34,400
<font face="Serif" size="18">of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding</font>

1305
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,202
<font face="Serif" size="18">from within the organization.</font>

1306
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:39,405
<font face="Serif" size="18">What will you do?</font>

1307
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:42,007
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is what you will do.</font>

1308
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:44,410
<font face="Serif" size="18">You will cling to Jehovah,</font>

1309
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,346
<font face="Serif" size="18">and you will experience him
holding on to you.</font>

1310
01:12:47,346 --> 01:12:49,048
<font face="Serif" size="18">You cling to him.</font>

1311
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:51,683
<font face="Serif" size="18">He holds on to you.</font>

1312
01:12:51,683 --> 01:12:53,752
<font face="Serif" size="18">For example,</font>

1313
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:57,589
<font face="Serif" size="18">I recall a time when a brother
serving in a foreign field</font>

1314
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:02,561
<font face="Serif" size="18">because of a misunderstanding
lost his privileges as an elder.</font>

1315
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:04,763
<font face="Serif" size="18">And he felt the decision was unfair.</font>

1316
01:13:04,763 --> 01:13:06,932
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was deeply hurt.</font>

1317
01:13:06,932 --> 01:13:11,203
<font face="Serif" size="18">But his wife— He and his wife
never stopped clinging to Jehovah</font>

1318
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:14,473
<font face="Serif" size="18">and their spiritual routine.</font>

1319
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then at a regional convention,</font>

1320
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:19,078
<font face="Serif" size="18">a brother approached him
and thanked him for the talk</font>

1321
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:22,014
<font face="Serif" size="18">that he gave on the program.</font>

1322
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:24,917
<font face="Serif" size="18">Well, he volunteered
in the cleaning department,</font>

1323
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,619
<font face="Serif" size="18">but he hadn’t given a talk.</font>

1324
01:13:27,619 --> 01:13:30,956
<font face="Serif" size="18">Then the brother
now said to this former elder:</font>

1325
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:34,560
<font face="Serif" size="18">“When I see your smile and positive attitude,</font>

1326
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,029
<font face="Serif" size="18">“yes, you gave a talk.</font>

1327
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:39,098
<font face="Serif" size="18">“And it was on loyalty,</font>

1328
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:41,934
<font face="Serif" size="18">and it was loud and clear.”</font>

1329
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:45,671
<font face="Serif" size="18">So the former elder now relates this:</font>

1330
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,740
<font face="Serif" size="18">“The experience taught me and my wife</font>

1331
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,943
<font face="Serif" size="18">“that every challenge or misfortune</font>

1332
01:13:50,943 --> 01:13:53,912
<font face="Serif" size="18">“does not need to represent a threat</font>

1333
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:57,116
<font face="Serif" size="18">“to our spiritual well-being.</font>

1334
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:59,418
<font face="Serif" size="18">“We’ve come to view rejection, failure,</font>

1335
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:02,988
<font face="Serif" size="18">“or being misunderstood as normal episodes</font>

1336
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:06,525
<font face="Serif" size="18">“in the lives of competent, healthy people.</font>

1337
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,562
<font face="Serif" size="18">Instead of being crushed, we grew.”</font>

1338
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:15,134
<font face="Serif" size="18">You see, the couple looked
beyond their hardships,</font>

1339
01:14:15,134 --> 01:14:17,970
<font face="Serif" size="18">and they clung to Jehovah.</font>

1340
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,138
<font face="Serif" size="18">How?</font>

1341
01:14:19,138 --> 01:14:22,407
<font face="Serif" size="18">By imitating Anna.</font>

1342
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:26,979
<font face="Serif" size="18">They were ‘never missing from true worship</font>

1343
01:14:26,979 --> 01:14:29,781
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘[in the right place],</font>

1344
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:33,051
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘rendering sacred service day and night</font>

1345
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,754
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘[doing the right thing]</font>

1346
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:37,956
<font face="Serif" size="18">with fasting and supplications.’</font>

1347
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:42,094
<font face="Serif" size="18">And sometimes
those supplications involve tears</font>

1348
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:45,230
<font face="Serif" size="18">but with the right attitude.</font>

1349
01:14:45,230 --> 01:14:50,202
<font face="Serif" size="18">And Jehovah held on to them and never let go.</font>

1350
01:14:50,202 --> 01:14:53,438
<font face="Serif" size="18">The brother is still serving
in the foreign field.</font>

1351
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,440
<font face="Serif" size="18">He is an elder again</font>

1352
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,477
<font face="Serif" size="18">and giving memorable talks.</font>

1353
01:15:00,879 --> 01:15:05,017
<font face="Serif" size="18">So, what do we want you
to remember from this talk?</font>

1354
01:15:06,618 --> 01:15:09,555
<font face="Serif" size="18">We want you to remember this:</font>

1355
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:14,459
<font face="Serif" size="18">When you come face-to-face with future trials
(and you will)</font>

1356
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:19,031
<font face="Serif" size="18">or challenges in your life
(and you will, this is what happens in life),</font>

1357
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:25,504
<font face="Serif" size="18">be in the right place,</font>

1358
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:28,106
<font face="Serif" size="18">do the right thing</font>

1359
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:30,576
<font face="Serif" size="18">with the right attitude.</font>

1360
01:15:30,576 --> 01:15:33,512
<font face="Serif" size="18">By doing this, you declare:</font>

1361
01:15:33,512 --> 01:15:36,481
<font face="Serif" size="18">“Jehovah, I cling to you,</font>

1362
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:39,918
<font face="Serif" size="18">and I trust you to hold on to me.”</font>

1363
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:50,295
<font face="Serif" size="18">Thank you very much, Brother Noumair.</font>

1364
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,665
<font face="Serif" size="18">Anna is a beautiful example
for all of us.</font>

1365
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,667
<font face="Serif" size="18">No doubt about it.</font>

1366
01:15:55,667 --> 01:16:00,205
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, our final prerecorded interview takes us</font>

1367
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:03,475
<font face="Serif" size="18">to the West African country of Ghana,</font>

1368
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:07,746
<font face="Serif" size="18">where David and Lynne Jones
currently serve.</font>

1369
01:16:07,746 --> 01:16:11,550
<font face="Serif" size="18">Upon their graduation from the 95th class</font>

1370
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,052
<font face="Serif" size="18">in September of 1993,</font>

1371
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:17,956
<font face="Serif" size="18">they were assigned
to the country of Kenya, East Africa.</font>

1372
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:21,193
<font face="Serif" size="18">They also served in Burundi for eight years.</font>

1373
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:23,962
<font face="Serif" size="18">Presently, they serve in Ghana,</font>

1374
01:16:23,962 --> 01:16:28,567
<font face="Serif" size="18">where Brother Jones serves
as a member of the Branch Committee there.</font>

1375
01:16:28,567 --> 01:16:32,104
<font face="Serif" size="18">Now, you might remember this couple
when you see the video</font>

1376
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:34,806
<font face="Serif" size="18">because their class was highlighted</font>

1377
01:16:34,806 --> 01:16:38,377
<font face="Serif" size="18">in the video <i>To the Ends of the Earth,</i></font>

1378
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:40,679
<font face="Serif" size="18">which marked the 50th anniversary</font>

1379
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,682
<font face="Serif" size="18">of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.</font>

1380
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:48,120
<font face="Serif" size="18">It was a very enlightening video for sure.</font>

1381
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,456
<font face="Serif" size="18">Although the purpose
of Gilead School training</font>

1382
01:16:51,456 --> 01:16:53,892
<font face="Serif" size="18">has changed since then,</font>

1383
01:16:53,892 --> 01:16:57,396
<font face="Serif" size="18">it’s clear from their heartfelt comments</font>

1384
01:16:57,396 --> 01:17:02,167
<font face="Serif" size="18">that they’ve proven to be
a stabilizing and strengthening influence</font>

1385
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,169
<font face="Serif" size="18">where they have served.</font>

1386
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:06,204
<font face="Serif" size="18">So enjoy the video.</font>

1387
01:17:09,775 --> 01:17:12,244
<font face="Serif" size="18">This is the day when we hand out assignments</font>

1388
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:13,912
<font face="Serif" size="18">to all of these students.</font>

1389
01:17:13,912 --> 01:17:15,914
<font face="Serif" size="18">The morning that we knew
we were going to get our assignment,</font>

1390
01:17:15,914 --> 01:17:17,949
<font face="Serif" size="18">we went down to morning worship,</font>

1391
01:17:17,949 --> 01:17:21,853
<font face="Serif" size="18">and then we had to line up,
and we were waiting to get our assignment.</font>

1392
01:17:21,853 --> 01:17:25,524
<font face="Serif" size="18">And my stomach was churning,
and I felt really sick</font>

1393
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:28,860
<font face="Serif" size="18">—sick with excitement
as well as the fact that you knew</font>

1394
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:30,762
<font face="Serif" size="18">that whatever Brother Jaracz said,</font>

1395
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:32,998
<font face="Serif" size="18">the next sentence that came out of his mouth</font>

1396
01:17:32,998 --> 01:17:35,233
<font face="Serif" size="18">would determine the rest of your life.</font>

1397
01:17:36,802 --> 01:17:38,337
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s hard to imagine</font>

1398
01:17:38,337 --> 01:17:40,305
<font face="Serif" size="18">that 28 years have gone by</font>

1399
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:41,873
<font face="Serif" size="18">since our initial assignment.</font>

1400
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:44,076
<font face="Serif" size="18">But Gilead training really helped us</font>

1401
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:45,677
<font face="Serif" size="18">to understand that things</font>

1402
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:46,845
<font face="Serif" size="18">wouldn’t always be easy.</font>

1403
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:49,147
<font face="Serif" size="18">And that when things weren’t easy,</font>

1404
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:51,450
<font face="Serif" size="18">we should never overreact to situations</font>

1405
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:53,885
<font face="Serif" size="18">but keep calm and trust in Jehovah.</font>

1406
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:57,222
<font face="Serif" size="18">I think one of the outstanding sections
of Gilead for me</font>

1407
01:17:57,222 --> 01:18:01,059
<font face="Serif" size="18">was the section dealing with
the Gospels and Jesus Christ.</font>

1408
01:18:01,059 --> 01:18:03,061
<font face="Serif" size="18">Jesus was always kind.</font>

1409
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:07,833
<font face="Serif" size="18">He was always reasonable
in his dealings with people.</font>

1410
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:11,903
<font face="Serif" size="18">And so in class, the emphasis was,
not on head knowledge,</font>

1411
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:16,241
<font face="Serif" size="18">but on how we can imitate Jesus Christ
in our dealings with others.</font>

1412
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:18,310
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I remember a couple of phrases:</font>

1413
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,313
<font face="Serif" size="18">People over productivity.</font>

1414
01:18:21,313 --> 01:18:24,916
<font face="Serif" size="18">And the kind thing
is always the right thing to do.</font>

1415
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:27,652
<font face="Serif" size="18">These lessons are still with me
all these years later.</font>

1416
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:30,422
<font face="Serif" size="18">We were taught how to study.</font>

1417
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:34,025
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it helped us to study in a way</font>

1418
01:18:34,025 --> 01:18:38,630
<font face="Serif" size="18">that would build a pool
or a foundation of principles</font>

1419
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,766
<font face="Serif" size="18">so that when we had a trial,</font>

1420
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:44,269
<font face="Serif" size="18">we would have somewhere to go
and dip into that pool of principles</font>

1421
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:47,406
<font face="Serif" size="18">that would apply to any situation
that we might face.</font>

1422
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:49,941
<font face="Serif" size="18">And it’s true
that at the time you go through it,</font>

1423
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:52,010
<font face="Serif" size="18">you’re taking in all the knowledge.</font>

1424
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:54,513
<font face="Serif" size="18">You don’t know when
and where you’re going to use it,</font>

1425
01:18:54,513 --> 01:18:56,782
<font face="Serif" size="18">but it teaches you the method of:</font>

1426
01:18:56,782 --> 01:18:59,284
<font face="Serif" size="18">Let’s store all this in the bank,
and then when I need it,</font>

1427
01:18:59,284 --> 01:19:01,319
<font face="Serif" size="18">I know where I can go and pick it from.</font>

1428
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,089
<font face="Serif" size="18">One example that comes to mind</font>

1429
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:09,094
<font face="Serif" size="18">is a lecture we had
that highlighted Romans 15:3,</font>

1430
01:19:09,094 --> 01:19:13,698
<font face="Serif" size="18">where it talked about
how “even the Christ did not please himself.”</font>

1431
01:19:13,698 --> 01:19:17,569
<font face="Serif" size="18">So thinking about that lecture
makes me think of a situation</font>

1432
01:19:17,569 --> 01:19:20,806
<font face="Serif" size="18">when we had been field missionaries
for a couple of years.</font>

1433
01:19:20,806 --> 01:19:23,909
<font face="Serif" size="18">We were invited
to go into the traveling work.</font>

1434
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:26,745
<font face="Serif" size="18">So I was thinking to myself,</font>

1435
01:19:26,745 --> 01:19:28,780
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘Can I really do this?’</font>

1436
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:31,283
<font face="Serif" size="18">But then I reflected back on that lecture</font>

1437
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:34,252
<font face="Serif" size="18">—Romans 15:3:
“The Christ [didn’t] please himself.”</font>

1438
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:35,787
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s not about me.</font>

1439
01:19:35,787 --> 01:19:37,589
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s about doing Jehovah’s will.</font>

1440
01:19:37,589 --> 01:19:39,124
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s about the people you serve.</font>

1441
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:40,425
<font face="Serif" size="18">Reflecting on that helped me</font>

1442
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:43,261
<font face="Serif" size="18">to see myself
in that big picture and realize,</font>

1443
01:19:43,261 --> 01:19:47,833
<font face="Serif" size="18">‘No, if Jesus could do that,
then this is what I have to do first</font>

1444
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:49,334
<font face="Serif" size="18">—I put the brothers and sisters first.’</font>

1445
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:52,270
<font face="Serif" size="18">And we thoroughly enjoyed being in that circuit.</font>

1446
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,272
<font face="Serif" size="18">I don’t even know why I was so worried.</font>

1447
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:56,741
<font face="Serif" size="18">Because at the end of three years,
we didn’t even want to leave.</font>

1448
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:04,149
<font face="Serif" size="18">The impact of Gilead
is not fully appreciated in the moment.</font>

1449
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:06,751
<font face="Serif" size="18">But as the years have gone by,</font>

1450
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:10,622
<font face="Serif" size="18">I do find myself reflecting on the lessons</font>

1451
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:13,291
<font face="Serif" size="18">that were taught during that class.</font>

1452
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,627
<font face="Serif" size="18">And I see how it’s shaped</font>

1453
01:20:15,627 --> 01:20:19,164
<font face="Serif" size="18">the way I think and feel
all these years later.</font>

1454
01:20:19,164 --> 01:20:20,832
<font face="Serif" size="18">So I would say, yeah,</font>

1455
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:25,837
<font face="Serif" size="18">it’s had a life- or personality-changing
effect on me.</font>

1456
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:30,008
<font face="Serif" size="18">When I think back of standing in that line,</font>

1457
01:20:30,008 --> 01:20:32,611
<font face="Serif" size="18">I mean, it is very vivid</font>

1458
01:20:32,611 --> 01:20:35,080
<font face="Serif" size="18">in my memory of how I felt.</font>

1459
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,884
<font face="Serif" size="18">And my stomach was definitely churning.</font>

1460
01:20:38,884 --> 01:20:43,088
<font face="Serif" size="18">But these 28 years,
I have not regretted one single minute of it.</font>

1461
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:44,422
<font face="Serif" size="18">Being with the brothers and sisters,</font>

1462
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:48,026

1463
01:20:48,026 --> 01:20:50,362
<font face="Serif" size="18">I can definitely say
without one shadow of a doubt</font>

1464
01:20:50,362 --> 01:20:52,998
<font face="Serif" size="18">that I still would not swap it for the world.</font>

<font face="Serif" size="18">to the brothers and sisters
in their assignments!</font>

1470
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:19,624

1474
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,472
<font face="Serif" size="18">let’s go to Tahiti.</font>

1475
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:38,877
<font face="Serif" size="18">It’s the main island of French Polynesia,</font>

1476
01:21:38,877 --> 01:21:42,781
<font face="Serif" size="18">a territory of about 118 inhabited islands.</font>

1478
01:21:45,517 --> 01:21:50,188
<font face="Serif" size="18">waterfalls, and white sand atolls.</font>

1479
01:21:50,188 --> 01:21:52,557
<font face="Serif" size="18">The surroundings teem with life.</font>

1480
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:55,694

1481
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:57,696
<font face="Serif" size="18">while the land produces</font>

1482
01:21:57,696 --> 01:21:59,931
<font face="Serif" size="18">an abundance of beautiful flower species.</font>

1483
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:01,933

1484
01:22:01,933 --> 01:22:04,736
<font face="Serif" size="18">is found not only in its natural scenery</font>

1485
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:08,707
<font face="Serif" size="18">but also in the hospitable attitude
of the people.</font>
